2017-10-16,"A central bank canseek to influence the level and shape of the yield curve by acting on two components of the longterm interest rates: the expectations component and the term premium. The expectationscomponent reflects market expectations of the future path of the policy-controlled short-terminterest rates. All else equal, a path that is lower and shallower tends to produce a lower level oflong-term yields and a flatter curve. The term premium reflects the excess return that an investordemands as a compensation for holding a bond with a long, say ten-year, residual maturityrelative to rolling over a short-term bill for ten years.",100

It is often conjectured that relevant policies arefederal, and therefore by definition uniform at the level of the federation; and that, as aconsequence, differences at the state level play much less a role.

2019-03-28,"Monetarypolicy independence extends indeed to a broader regulation power and a role as “guardian of theTreaty”. For monetary policy this does not mean, however, that we will inevitably and over-hastily return tothe limited set of instruments and the balance sheet size of the pre-crisis period. Regulatorychanges and the enduring fragmentation of European financial markets may in the future requiresome adjustments to our operational framework for monetary policy within our well-establishedstrategy.

2000-11-20,"One might try to examine the link between the role of the euro in international financial markets andrecent trends in the euro area’s balance of payments. Of course, there is no one-to-one correspondencebetween the two concepts. Nevertheless, one can observe a correlation, or co-movement, between theinternational role of the euro in financial markets and the euro area financial account. In particular, theeuro area capital outflows in 1999 are consistent with indications that the euro was used more as afinancing than as an investment currency.",84
2009-04-23,"The latter happened in a context of quickly rising incomes, growing productivity andcommodity prices in emerging economies, and was partly attributable to structural factorssuch as:•the propensity of residents to accumulate precautionary savings due to lackingwelfare provisions; and•relative financial underdevelopment. Recent studies show 4 that the lower degree of financial development in emergingeconomies, compared with mature economies, has been one important driver of capital flowsto mature economies. In fact, the lack of supply in “safe” financial assets in emergingeconomies can trigger capital flows to regions that are able to produce the desired assets.",92
2007-07-13,"To this end, the ECB, in close co-operationwith the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Malta, have embarked incomprehensive euro information campaigns on the euro banknotes and coins in the twocountries and will take all measures necessary to ensure a successful transition from theCyprus and Maltese pounds to the euro.

2009-03-17,"The moneymarket – where banks lend to each other on a very short term – appeared to be the mostintegrated. Also, government and corporate bond markets have been quite integrated, too. Incontrast, equity and retail banking markets are the least integrated. Three conclusions stand out in this regard. First, integration is typically more advanced inthose markets that are closer to the single monetary policy. Second, wholesale markets tendto be more integrated than retail markets. Third, market integration is correlated with thedegree of integration of the related underlying market infrastructures such as payments andsecurities settlement systems. 2.",96

There is one notable exception to this statement, namely the provision ofunlimited liquidity for two weeks over the turn of year 2007/2008, which resulted in atemporary expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet.

2013-11-18,"It reflected the ambient overreliance on thedisciplinary effects of markets. Fiscal policies remained at national level. The Stability andGrowth Pact provided rules to mitigate this situation but their implementation by the Councilof Ministers often lacked traction and facilitated fiscal indiscipline. Second, macroeconomic imbalances often precede fiscal disequilibria. But the Treaty onlyprovided for a vague coordination of economic policies which on top were not determinedlypushed by the Commission. Third, Europe lacked a coherent approach to financial sector policies. Regulatory frameworksand financial policies remained insufficiently harmonised and centralised, neglecting theincreasing level of financial integration in the euro area.",96

2017-01-09,"We have seen recently significantcorrections in bond yields. This is not all bad: higher yields and wider spreads recreate scope fora proper assessment of risks.

Starting from these premises, there is clearly no reason for monetary policy to react tospecific financial market developments. Of course, a central bank may want to monitorfinancial and monetary developments, which should be factored into the policy process to theextent that they contain information about the inflation outlook at a specific policy horizon(usually two years).

Central banks should adjust theirobjectives downwards accordingly. If this argument were accurate, it would constitute a very fundamental criticism of centralbanks’ mandates. After all, the decision to grant central banks price stability objectives, andto give them independence to deliver those objectives, was based on the understanding thatinflation is always, ultimately, a monetary phenomenon. It could thus always be controlled inthe medium-term by a committed monetary authority.",91

As regards financing conditions in the euro area, external financing costs have beendeclining since October last year, and particularly sharply since the start of this year.

In the area of fiscal policy, progress in structural fiscal consolidation remains slow and thereare risks that some countries will pursue expansionary pro-cyclical fiscal policies. For theexecution of 2007 budgets and the planning of 2008 budgets, it is crucial that the mistakesmade during the previous economic upswing of 1999-2000 are not repeated. At present,countries with fiscal imbalances need to correct them in line with the requirements of theStability and Growth Pact.",89

In such circumstances, the inflation process can become subject to short-term spells ofinertial drift 3.

2015-02-12,"Specifically, as expected returns on securities will be compressed, maintaining net interestincome will require banks to shift their portfolios away from securities and towards loans tofirms and households. Indeed, one reason that credit growth has been weak, especially inperipheral countries, is that the risk adjusted returns for banks on loans have been verysubdued relative to returns on securities portfolios – especially domestic government bonds. Moreover, as credit conditions further ease and the macroeconomic outlook improves, thereshould be an endogenous effect on borrowing conditions.",83

And they must substantiallyreinforce the Stability and Growth Pact. And it is not only fiscal policies that need to be brought back onto the path of virtue. Inseveral countries, macroeconomic policies more generally need to be aligned with bestpractice.",93

The benefits of such behaviour have already been seen. Moreover, there is abroad consensus that the larger part of the still high level of unemployment is of a structural nature;this challenge needs to be addressed continuously by policies which remove structural rigidities fromthe labour markets and which diminish adverse incentives provided by tax, benefit and pensionsystems.",93

Hence financial markets andfinancial institutions contributed 62% to the absorption of idiosyncratic state shocks.

2015-11-30,Low interest rates create false incentives since they reduce the pressure on the respectivegovernments to make savings and reforms. And reforms are what the euro area needs. Thelower interest burden and the possibility of new borrowing at favourable rates make it easierfor the euro area Member States to service their debts. This may lead to a relaxation of reformefforts by governments. The situation becomes more difficult when it’s more than a matter of easing the government’sdebt burden but if the debt level of government budgets continues to grow during the lowinterest phase.,92

As a quid proquo for its independence, the ECB is accountable for its actions to the people’srepresentatives, who are elected to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage. At a time when so many European citizens express doubts about Europe, the duty of Europeaninstitutions is to strengthen their legitimacy both by reinforcing their democratic accountabilityand by showing that they meet the objectives they’ve been entrusted with.",90

We are confident that the effects of our asset purchases continue to feed through to euro area financialconditions and support a more accommodative monetary policy stance. The experience we have built upover the last five years does not indicate that asset purchases entail diminishing returns over time.",99

Conditionality serves to ensure thatgovernments continue to correct existing economic and fiscal weaknesses when OMTs are activated. At the sametime, OMT purchases will not take place while a country programme is under review. The ECB’s actionscomplement, but do not replace, economic and fiscal reform. Incentives also help explain why interventions willfocus on shorter-term debt. Purchases of sovereign bonds will be suspended, should a country fail to comply withits conditionality requirements.",94
2010-10-14,"The second point is about the lessons that central banks can learn from the past to guidetheir future monetary policy. Pisani-Ferry and Posen cite three episodes in the past whichcentral bankers should look at carefully, namely the Great Depression, Japan’s lost decadeand, more generally, previous experiences of post-financial crisis periods.

2018-05-14,"An important lesson from the crisis was that the euro area had insufficient tools at its disposal to,on the one hand, prevent the build-up of unsustainable asset price booms and, on the otherhand, mitigate their impact if they occured. The answer to such problems lies, ex ante, in bettermacroprudential and microprudential policies and better regulation of the financial system and, expost, in better resolution institutions. Strengthening Europe’s financial framework, including theestablishment of the banking union, is the right way to address this source of macroeconomicimbalances.

Financial stability involvesdifferent tools. As far as we are concerned, it’s a question of bank regulation and“macroprudential” tools. There is one effect you didn’t mention: this policy cuts governments’ interest ratecosts and potentially gives them room for fiscal manoeuvre again. That is not our objective.",100

2012-04-20,"Broadly speaking, these have come from two sources: first, thedeflationary forces stemming from the economic downturn and, second, the impairment ofthe transmission of its monetary policy, which reflected to the growing tensions in financialmarkets. The ECB had to react decisively to these challenges. First, we used our standard monetary policy measures to address the downward pressureson price stability that resulted from the sharp slowdown in economic activity in the crisis. Infull consistency with our mandate, we reduced our key policy interest rate rapidly betweenOctober 2008 and May 2009, from 4.25% to 1%.",92

The monetary pillar is firmly established and the ECB has fully delivered on itsmandate to maintain price stability at below and close to 2%, over the medium term. Over thefirst 11½ years of the euro, the average annual inflation rate has been 1.97%. What is more,inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our mandate. In contrast, the economic pillar of our union remains under construction and there is muchwork to do.",86

This has been accompanied byeconomic performance in terms of growth per capita and job creation that comparespositively with other large advanced economies.

I wouldagree that the pace of reform in these areas has been relatively moderate, but progress has beenmade in a number of countries and the overall sentiment on the need for, and the support of, reformsis changing in the right direction.",87
2017-08-24,"Pricestability emerged in both central bank mandates and macroeconomic models as the overridingobjective that central banks should pursue in order to maximise social welfare. In the words of aninfluential article, one could see a “science of monetary policy” developing next to the traditional“art” of monetary policy.3But there was a notable absence of a role for banking and finance in these models. Wage andprice rigidities, together with a few other frictions, appeared to be sufficient to provide a realisticcharacterisation of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the main macroeconomicmodels.",89
2007-06-21,"Although labour mobility is still limited worldwide, the increased flexibility of capital flows implies thatfirms now have much easier access to global labour supply than before. As a result, many industrieshave set up supply chains on a global scale. Let me now provide you with some figures to document the magnitude and scope ofglobalisation. Global trade openness – measured as world exports and imports of goods andservices as a share of world GDP – has practically doubled over the last 20 years, from 33.9% ofworld GDP in 1986 to 60% of world GDP in 2006.",95
2011-06-15,"Some banks took more risk than others in the real estatebubble, and some banks recorded substantially lower profits and higher (realized andpotential) loan losses during the current crisis. Hence, bank capital significantly decreased,especially for some groups of cajas; they, moreover, cannot easily raise capital because oftheir specific structure. The availability of bank capital is essential for two additional reasons:First, a bank capital crunch may lead to a credit crunch. Thus, in order to help the realeconomy recover, some weak banks need to be recapitalised.",84
2012-03-27,"Our strategy has supported this mechanism in normal times. In crisis times, as marketsceased to transmit price signals, our tools had to change. The Eurosystem’s response hasbeen timely; all non-standard measures have been temporary and tailored to the specialfeatures of the euro area. Our tools have changed but our strategy has not – it is in factsupporting a gradual process of normalisation. The euro area is an economic and monetary union (EMU). Its monetary pillar has performedwell so far and will continue its work in the future. The economic pillar is now beingconsiderably strengthened.",94
2020-03-02,"For central banks, this means that the effects of monetary policy may, at times, take longer to showthrough in underlying inflation, in particular in periods of elevated uncertainty. It also means that profit margins may currently operate like a benign supply-side shock: they lift output butthey suppress inflation.[18]Chart 14Mark-up shocks act like benign supply-side shocksDecomposition of euro area real GDP based on the New Area-Wide Model II(annual rates, deviations from model-implied steady state in pp)Notes: The figure presents the decomposition of euro area real GDP into structural shocks based on the New Area-WideModel (NAWM) II.",95
2011-06-20,"We considerthat such anchoring has been a very important element in the way we went through thecrisis; we avoided not only the materialisation of inflation risks in normal times but, in theseexceptionally difficult times since the intensification of the crisis in 2008, also thematerialisation of deflationary risks. We had some words from Barack Obama last week about the importance that thiscrisis is well-handled, saying if it is not well handled it could have seriousconsequences for the US economy. Would you share that view? I have no particular comment on what the President of the United States said.",97
2015-12-14,"For marketsto be truly free, therefore, they need governance. This is true at the global level and it is true at the European level. But it is even more true forcountries that share a single market and a single currency. Those countries have enteredinto an irrevocable union, built on the fertile ground of Europe’s common values and history,but also on deep mutual vulnerability. For those countries it is even more important tocomplete economic and monetary union in all its aspects. BIS central bankers’ speeches5",84
2010-03-24,"At thesame time, it is important that fiscal surveillance under the Pact remains a process of its ownright and that the fundamental principles of the Treaty and the Pact are fully preserved. A successful exit from the strong fiscal expansion in the wake of the recent crisis will requireambitious measures and a strong political will regarding implementation. I am confident thatEuropean fiscal policy makers will succeed in restoring the sustainability of public finances. The adjustment efforts undertaken by the Irish government and more recently by the Greekgovernment can be seen as promising first steps in the upcoming consolidation process.",99
2008-02-29,"Reforms would help to enhance market efficiency and benefit Europeanconsumers in the form of lower prices. In order to allow consumers to profit from lower farmgate prices, adequate competition in the downstream sectors (food processing, retail tradeand catering) and compliance with Single Market provisions are necessary. The successfulconclusion of the Doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve thefunctioning of global trade in general, and of agricultural markets in Europe and worldwide inparticular. Turning to risks of inflationary pressures from emerging economies, currently, some limitedinflationary pressures appear to be originating from NMS (Chart 7).",97
2017-04-04,"What stage has Europe reached in the process of banking union? We are just over half-way along the path to banking union. There is a need to distinguish betweenthe area of regulation and supervision, where we have made great progress, and the field ofcrisis resolution, i.e. what to do when a bank fails, where much remains to be done. What do you mean by that? If, for financial stability reasons, a bank is not able to rescue itself by calling on its investors (bailin), it currently still falls to the national authority to respond (bail-out).",95
2017-06-09,"The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of theprincipal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. Our monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very favourable financingconditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levelsbelow, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The information that has become available sinceour last monetary policy meeting in late April confirms a stronger momentum in the euro areaeconomy, which is projected to expand at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected. Weconsider that the risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced.",100
1999-09-08,"TheEuropean Central Bank and the Eurosystem have assumed their new responsibilities, and the monetarypolicy instruments and decision-making procedures are functioning well. A unified euro area financialmarket is developing as operators re-orient their activities beyond the borders of their previousdomestic markets. However, it is altogether natural that not all facets of the complex EMU project are as yet complete.

2006-05-29,"The euro area HICP index for telecommunications fell by 35% relative tothe overall euro area HICP index in the period 1998-2005. The third prerequisite for higher growth in the euro area is the unlocking of business potential bycreating an entrepreneurial-friendly economic environment. This includes lowering costs imposed bypublic sector administrations for existing firms and business start-ups. Let me illustrate this with somefigures. According to the World Bank, in 2004, the average cost of starting a business with up to 50employees in the euro area (excluding Luxembourg) is estimated to have been around ten times largerthan in the US 12 .",100

2014-05-28,"Let’s not forget that – since the early 1990s when the industrial worlderadicated inflation – the emphasis in the “constrained discretion” oxymoron has alwaysbeen on constrained. In the early 1990s rules won a long battle over discretion. And rules meant a numericaldefinition of the inflation objective and a flexible but certain horizon for accomplishing theobjective. Pushing on a string when the transmission of monetary policy stimulus is impeded by thecountervailing forces of deleveraging can be counterproductive. At the same time, acceptinglow or even negative inflation rates in such a situation may render the balance sheetadjustment more painful and drawn-out.",99
2015-09-28,"Third, banks’ senior management and boards have to create adequate incentive schemes,including remuneration policies, to promote long-term perspectives within their organisation. We have witnessed too many scandals over recent years, too many cases of misconductwhere responsible parties were not sufficiently held accountable. We have witnessed bankscooperating only reluctantly in criminal investigations, and we have seen interest groupsrejecting outright any attempt to reform remuneration in the banking sector. Regaining trust will not be easy. Bank managers must convince the public that they willreward socially beneficial behaviour, while unacceptable behaviour will be crediblysanctioned, up to the top.",95
2017-09-27,"History teaches us that central banks’ success in sustainably maintaining confidence in thecurrency critically hinges on two elements: political independence and a clear mandate. TheECB was successfully built on these principles. Independence and a clear stability-orientedmandate ensure that central banks are not overburdened with pursuing other, potentiallyconflicting objectives, and that monetary policy makes the best possible contribution to growthand employment. They are therefore also a necessary condition for strengthening the use oflocal currencies.",73
2008-11-21,"Second, I will briefly describe the role of privatepension funds in financial markets in general and look more specifically at their role as longterm oriented investors in the current environment. Thirdly, I will reflect on the impact of institutional investors on the transmission of monetarypolicy and the ensuing consequences for the conduct of monetary policy.

2009-02-17,"Over the longerterm, there is globalisation, with the rise of emerging market economies such as China andIndia, the rapid advances in science and technology and the ageing of our population. Allthese phenomena affect the economic environment in which central banks conduct monetarypolicy. BIS Review 16/20097The enlargement of the currency area for which we bear responsibility is a challenge specificto the ECB.

BIS Review 13/20091Tensions in the markets for credit instruments spread to the money markets in early August2007, giving rise to concerns about systemic disruptions. Indeed, inter-bank trading camealmost to a halt on 9 August as a result of the combination of: (1) exceptionally highuncertainty about potential direct exposures of banks to “toxic” assets; and (2) increaseddemand for liquidity to honour credit lines committed to so-called conduits (i.e. banksponsored off-balance sheet investment vehicles).",88

Moreover, monetary policy that credibly preserves price stability promotes financial stability.

A – This question is very important, because our primary mandate is price stability in themedium term, which we define as below, but close to, 2%.

I would like to be clear that I refer to providing a European dimension to the institutionalframework and not to a centralization of the competences pertaining to a Banking Union. Even a fully federal system implies, by nature, decentralization of tasks between the federaland the lower levels. In Europe, subsidiarity and proportionality are key constitutionalprinciples in the exercise of European competences, which are particularly crucial for awell-functioning Banking Union.",100
2003-06-27,"I have no doubtthat inflation is a monetary phenomenon over the long term and that we are right in attributing aprominent role to monitoring monetary developments in our monetary policy strategy. A fifth point I would like to make is that it was difficult to gauge the effects of globalinterdependencies when we began to conduct the single monetary policy. What we have learnt, inparticular, is that global linkages go well beyond the international trade channel, which wastraditionally considered to be the main, if not the only channel through which economic shocks weretransmitted.",92

This definition stems from the intuition that lack of integration reflects the existence ofbarriers to cross-border activities.

This is immediately obvious in the case of fiduciary money or sightdeposits which are remunerated only a little or not at all (which accounted for 39% of the monetaryaggregate M3 in 1999).",93

Numerous studies indicate that this can beassumed to be the case if central banks aim to maintain the inflation rate above 1%.6A further factor in favour of tolerating low, positive levels of inflation is the possible existence of apositive measurement bias in the calculation of the consumer price index.

In this case, the year-over-year increase in provisions or charge-offs are used instead, inorder to minimise the impact of normal operations on the figures. Unless it is certain that loan charge-offs are not included innew provisions for losses, these charge-offs are only recorded for 2007. The underlying assumption is that charge-offs afterthe end of 2007 are already included in previously recorded provisions. Some banks do not expect to fully realise thesewrite-downs, especially in the case of unrealised losses, mark-to-market losses, and loss provisions.",96

2017-11-17,Such widely differing perceptions across countries pose a challenge for central bankcommunication in our monetary union. The ECB has sought to address this challenge with what I would refer to as a “two-layeredfederal structure of communication”.

So there is a need for consolidation – consolidation which leads to stronger bankswith viable business models. Third, many banks still have high costs, partly because of their large branch networks. But howlarge do these networks actually need to be in this age of digital banking? Fourth, some banks are still weighed down by impaired balance sheets.

This is clearly in the interest of a CCP’s good risk management, but it may alsoincrease risk in the wider system. The key is to avoid pro-cyclicality. It then extends to this notion of supervisory stress testing with a macro dimension. Developing a framework for supervisory stress testing should therefore be a priority. It willtake time, but it will go a long way to support a better understanding of the macro-prudentialrisks of CCPs. Are other supervisors keen to embrace this idea?",97

2009-10-22,"Against the background of these concerns, it is important to make a number of observations. First, looking ahead it is likely that loans to enterprises may moderate further before startingto recover. This would also be in line with past evidence, which indicates that the growth ofloans to non-financial corporations tends to lag GDP growth by about three quarters. Thismay be related to the fact that non-financial corporations usually see their cash flowsimprove early in an economic upturn and thus tend to finance working capital and fixedinvestment with internal funds first, and only later with external financing.",96

This led to the creation of the European Monetary System'sExchange Rate Mechanism (EMS/ERM) in 1979.

The low level ofinterest rates, both in nominal and real terms, and the generally favourable financing conditions havebeen lending support to the ongoing economic recovery in the euro area.

Thiswould require targeted measures to help alleviate credit constraints. I would like to dwellshortly on this contingency because it relates to the important question of whether weakcredit growth results from low credit demand or supply constraints. Weak credit demand in the early stages of an economic recovery is not unusual. Creditgrowth typically lags the recovery by three to four quarters as firms draw down internal funds. But a recovery eventually results in growing credit demand.,99

Thus, insufficient fiscal consolidation leads to a continuous eviction by the states of a significant partof the available private savings. In the same way, excessive taxation and wage increases out of linewith growth in productivity sap the dynamism from investment and consequently also from savings.",90
2000-01-20,"With regard to the exchange rate of the euro, Ishould like to say the following: at the moment the European economy is clearly recovering and theoutlook is favourable. As a consequence, the euro has great potential for appreciation. This potential isalso firmly based on internal price stability and a sound current account position. 2. The international use of the euro as an investment and financing currencyAlthough the international community makes use of the euro for several other reasons (such aspayment, pegging, etc.), the utilisation of this currency in the global financial market is the drivingforce behind its internationalisation.",98
2014-10-20,"Non-conventional monetary policy however, in particular large scale asset purchases, seemto widen income inequality, although this is challenging to quantify. Still, a central bank with a clear mandate to safeguard price stability needs to act forcefullywhen push comes to shove. These distributional side-effects then need to be tolerated. Butthey clearly should not last too long. They are one more reason to recognise that the nonstandard measures we have introduced have to be temporary.

That is to say, they aresimply the mirror image of global and euro area specific factors that are pulling both longterm nominal and real interest rates down to very low levels.

For now, there is little tangible evidence that the moderation in growth has affected businessinvestment. But there is some evidence that those euro area firms that are most likely to beaffected by proposed tariffs have reduced their rate of capital spending.

2004-05-18,"How we have contributed and continue to contribute to sustainable non-inflationary growthThe “magnetic north” of our compass is the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Since1999, the medium to long-term inflation expectations, extracted either from the ECB Survey ofProfessional Forecasters or from surveys conducted by private institutions such as ConsensusEconomics, have remained in line with our objective of price stability, fluctuating within a narrow bandaround 1.8%-1.9%. It is true that actual inflation has several times risen above the ceiling of 2% since 1999. But thisoccurred in a difficult environment with many adverse price shocks.",96
2015-11-17,"This reveals a lack of productivity and innovation. The ECBcannot do much about that. On top of this, there are external risks: slowing global growth,particularly in large emerging economies. In other words, it’s pointless to expect that an eventual increase in quantitative easingwill be enough to stimulate investment…Quantitative easing, by pushing back the horizon for monetary policy action, removed thefinancing obstacle. Lending rates to enterprises have fallen significantly, including in thestressed euro area countries. What we can do, what we must do, is maintain confidence ininflation returning towards our objective of 2%.",92

1999-06-09,"People would not want to hold on to the currency of an issuer that was expected to depreciate relativeto one that was expected to hold its value in terms of purchasing power over goods and services. Therefore, good money that maintained its purchasing power would drive out the depreciation- andinflation-prone bad money. However, it is not inconceivable that competing private issuers woulddecide to collude by fixing the relative values of their currencies. They would do this by agreeing tointervene mutually whenever any of the currencies in question came under pressure in the market forthese currencies.",95

2013-10-28,"This experience contrasts with Japan’s experience in the late 1980s. Following the burstingof Japan’s asset bubble, there was by and large no rapid write-down of non-performingassets. Due to the low profitability of banks, it was believed that an immediate write-off of badloans would prevent compliance with capital requirements. The recognition of losses waspostponed and, as a consequence, capital continued to be allocated to investments withlimited positive impact on Japan’s long-term growth potential, which some have called“zombie lending”4. Ultimately, this resulted in Japan’s “lost decade”, namely an extendedperiod of anaemic growth (see Chart 3).",93

In my view there are very good reasons for that. On top of their key involvement in thefinancial sector, central banks possess three main features that are qualifying themselves forthat function: they are, by their very nature, anchors of stability; they are medium-termoriented; and they are independent. Central banks have traditionally been active in financial stability analysis. Of course, fromfinancial stability analysis to macro-prudential supervision is yet another step.",91

2008-07-03,You may recall that John Maynard Keynes once cautionedagainst such a strategy by warning that “The market can stay irrational longer than you canstay solvent.” One explanation for this is that speculating against the market requires acritical mass of investors that will act in synchronised or coordinated manner and will be ableto push prices back towards fundamental values. This may not be easy when markets aredeep and liquid as they tend to be during upswings. The “coordination problem” maytherefore substantially delay arbitrage.,82
