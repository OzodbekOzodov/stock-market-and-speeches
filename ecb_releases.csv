Europa Open Air 2023 celebrates Europe’s diversity in Frankfurt
Over 12,000 guests expected for musical evening on waterfront
On Thursday, 31 August 2023 the European Central Bank (ECB), together with broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk, will once again present the traditional Europa Open Air concert with the Hessischer Rundfunk orchestra, Frankfurt Radio Symphony. The popular concert at Frankfurt’s waterfront location Weseler Werft will allow spectators to enjoy some of Europe’s finest concert pieces, with “celebrating Europe” as the theme. This year the event coincides with the 25th anniversary of the ECB.
“Europa Open Air reflects the ECB’s commitment as a European institution and as a member of the local community. Music, literature and the performing and fine arts know no borders; they allow us to be united in diversity,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The evening will start with a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Big Band, accompanied by soul singer Joy Denalane. Conducted by music director Alain Altinoglu, the Frankfurt Radio Symphony will then present pieces based on musical fairy tales. The event will close with two works featuring Mediterranean rhythms.
The concert will be broadcast live over the internet, and on German TV and radio. Further information (in German) can be found on Hessischer Rundfunk’s website.

Compared with May 2023:
consumer inflation expectations decreased both for the next 12 months and for the three years ahead;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months remained unchanged, while expectations for nominal spending growth declined further;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became slightly less negative, while the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time was unchanged;
expectations for growth in the price of homes over the next 12 months remained unchanged, while expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead decreased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months was unchanged at 8.0%. However, median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased further to 3.4%, from 3.9% in May, and those for inflation three years ahead also declined, easing to 2.3% from 2.5% in May. Having fallen in the previous two months, uncertainty about inflation expectations over the next 12 months was unchanged. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the three-year horizon. Inflation perceptions and expectations remained closely aligned across income groups, although younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to increase by 1.2%, as in May. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months decreased further to 6.7%, from 6.8% in May. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months also decreased further to 3.4%, from 3.5% in May, their lowest level since March 2022. The drop in expectations for nominal spending growth was observed among both younger (aged 18-24) and older (aged 55-70) respondents. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months were slightly less negative, standing at -0.6%, compared with -0.7% in May. Expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead were unchanged at 11.0%. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be only slightly higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (10.9%), implying a broadly stable labour market. Compared with March 2023, expectations for economic growth were 0.4 percentage points less negative and expectations for the unemployment rate 0.7 percentage points lower, reflecting more positive sentiment about the expected economic outlook. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.1% over the next 12 months, stabilising at a two-year low. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead decreased slightly to 5.0%, from 5.1% in May. This decline was mainly driven by the expectations of medium and high-income groups, while the expectations of the two lower income quantiles were unchanged. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months again eased slightly, as in May, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months were broadly unchanged.

,"Summary
In the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2023, expectations for headline HICP inflation were broadly unchanged compared to the previous survey (conducted in the second quarter).
[

]
However, these unchanged aggregate expectations concealed downward revision to HICP energy and food and upward revisions to expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX). The latter reportedly reflecting recent data outturns showing more persistence than expected as well as higher forecast wage growth. Headline inflation was expected to decline from 5.5% in 2023 to 2.7% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Longer-term HICP inflation expectations (for 2028 in this survey round and for 2027 in the previous survey) were unchanged at 2.1%. Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations remained at elevated levels, while the balance of risks remained broadly neutral. Real GDP growth expectations were unchanged for 2023 but slightly down for 2024 and 2025. There was also a downward tilt in the balance of risks. The short-term GDP outlook implied a modest but constant increase in economic activity over the period from the second quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024. Longer-term GDP growth expectations were revised down slightly to 1.3%. Unemployment expectations were around 6.6-6.7% for 2023 to 2025 but declined to 6.5% for 2028.

1 Limited revisions to HICP inflation expectations for 2023-25
SPF respondents made limited revisions to their HICP inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024. Inflation expectations for 2023 were revised downward by 0.1 percentage points to 5.5%, while those for 2024 were revised upward by 0.1 percentage points to 2.7%. Those for 2025 were unchanged at 2.2% (see Chart 1). Compared with the June 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which were based on May 2023 HICP data as the latest available information, inflation expectations in this SPF round were 0.1 percentage points higher for 2023, and 0.3 percentage points lower for 2024 and 2025 (see Table 1).
Chart 1
Inflation expectations: overall HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy and food
(annual percentage changes)
Regarding the nearer-term outlook, respondents emphasised lower energy prices and lower food price inflation. Taken together, the information on HICP and HICPX expectations suggests that SPF respondents have revised downward significantly their expectations for the sum of HICP energy and food for 2023 (and, to a lesser extent, also for 2024 and 2025).
SPF expectations for inflation excluding energy and food were revised up for 2023 and 2024. HICPX expectations for 2023, 2024 and 2025 stood at 5.1%, 3.1% and 2.3% respectively – representing upward revisions of 0.2 percentage points for 2023 and 0.3 percentage points for 2024 but no change for 2025. Respondents indicated that the upward revisions reflected recent data outturns showing more persistence than expected as well as higher forecast wage growth. Regarding labour costs, respondents cited the mix of elevated inflation and labour market tightness as the main influencing factors. At a more disaggregated level, for (non-energy, non-food) goods, respondents noted a number of factors indicating some moderation of consumer inflation. These factors were easing supply pressures, the abating of indirect effects from past energy price hikes and declines in some non-labour input costs. On the other hand, they considered that wage pressures would exert inflationary pressure on services. The upward revisions to the SPF forecasts for HICPX brought them closer in line with those from the June 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections (see Table 1).
Despite easing substantially, quantitative indicators of uncertainty surrounding the shorter and medium-term inflation outlook remained above levels observed prior to 2022.
[

]
The high level of “aggregate uncertainty” (the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution) stemmed from a combination of a high average level of “individual uncertainty” and substantial “disagreement” across forecasters about their point forecasts. There was a decline in two-year-ahead aggregate uncertainty in this SPF round, which mainly stemmed from disagreement (measured by the standard deviation of point expectations) down to 0.6 percentage points - but it still stood at more than twice the historical average since 1999. Average individual uncertainty (measured by the average of the standard deviations of the individual probability distributions) was broadly unchanged at an elevated level (0.9 percentage points) – about 50% higher than the historical average since 1999. Aggregate probability distributions for the calendar years from 2023 to 2025 are presented in Chart 2. The quantitative balance of risk indicator (calculated as the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution minus the average reported point expectation) for the two-year ahead horizon remained to the upside, although the risk associated with very high outcomes of 5% or higher decreased. In their qualitative remarks, respondents noted that the main risks related to energy prices as well as to possible wage developments. For energy prices, both downside and upside risks were mentioned. Wage developments were generally considered an upside risk.
Chart 2
Aggregate probability distributions for expected inflation in 2023, 2024 and 2025
(x-axis: HICP inflation expectations, annual percentage changes; y-axis: probability, percentages)
Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in 2023, 2024 and 2025. To minimise the number of bins in the questionnaire, the upper bin for inflation outcomes was set at ? 5.0%. The fact that this would lead to most probability being assigned to the upper bin for some horizons was flagged to respondents when sending out the questionnaire.
2 Longer-term inflation expectations unchanged
Longer-term inflation expectations (which relate to 2028) were unchanged at 2.1%. When excluding (trimming) the two highest and lowest responses, the average was stable at 2.1% for the fifth consecutive survey round.
[
3
]
The median and modal point expectations were unchanged at 2.0%, while the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution was unchanged at 2.1% (see Chart 3). Thus, having increased noticeably since the third quarter of 2021, there are growing signs that longer-term inflation expectations have levelled off. The modal (i.e. most frequent) and median value of the distribution of individual point forecasts was unchanged at 2.0% in this survey round (see Chart 4). However, in the past two rounds there has been a drop in the number of respondents reporting longer-term inflation expectations of below 1.9%. The distribution of longer-term inflation expectations has become much more focused on 2.0%, and expectations of inflation lower than 2% have subsided significantly.

(x-axis: longer-term HICP inflation expectations, annual percentage changes; y-axis: percentages of respondents)
Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the spread of point forecast responses. In the ECB SPF round in the third quarter of 2023, longer-term expectations referred to 2028. In the prior two rounds they referred to 2027.
Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations remained at elevated levels, while the balance of risks remained broadly neutral. The high level of “aggregate uncertainty” (the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution – see Chart 5) stemmed from a combination of elevated “disagreement” (measured as the standard deviation of the individual point forecasts) and heightened “individual uncertainty” (measured by the average width of the individual probability distributions). The balance of risk indicator remained close to zero (i.e. neutral). The aggregate probability associated with longer-term inflation being in the range 1.5-2.5% decreased marginally to 47% from 49% in the previous survey round, absorbed by an increase in the probabilities associated with outcomes above this range (i.e. >2.5%), which rose to 34% from 32%. The probability associated with longer-term inflation being below this range (i.e. <1.5%) was unchanged at 20%.

In the ECB SPF round in the third quarter of 2023, longer-term expectations referred to 2028. In the prior two rounds they referred to 2027.
The mean longer-term expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX) rose 0.1 percentage points to 2.1%.
[
4
]
However, the median and modal longer-term point expectations for HICPX were unchanged at 2.0%. Broadly speaking, the evolution of longer-term expectations for HICP and HICPX inflation has been similar for the period of available data since the fourth quarter of 2016 (when respondents were first asked about their expectations for HICPX), with a level difference of around 0.1 percentage points on average. However, in this survey round, the gap was closed through the upward revision of HICPX expectations, which appeared to stem from a shift to 2.0% from those reporting 1.9% or lower in the previous round.
3 Real GDP growth expectations unchanged for 2023 but revised downward slightly for subsequent years
GDP growth expectations in the third quarter of 2023 stood at 0.6% for 2023, 1.1% for 2024 and 1.5% for 2025 (see Chart 6). While expectations for 2023 remained unchanged from the previous survey round, the outlook for both 2024 and 2025 was revised downward by 0.1 percentage points. Respondents reported that the easing of inflation and the upward evolution in wage growth were seen as partially offsetting the previous losses of purchasing power and thus supporting private consumption. However, tighter monetary conditions and uncertainty about possible further tightening were slowing economic activity, particularly investment. This was seen as being compounded by a slowdown due to the weak manufacturing sector, with headwinds from the slower than expected recovery in China. However, respondents considered services sector resilience as partially countering this weakness and thus broadly maintained their earlier expectations for real GDP growth in 2023. The downward revisions of 0.1 percentage points for 2024 and 2025 largely reflected growing concerns about the persistence of core inflation and its slower than expected decline. In this context, decisions regarding the pace and magnitude of rate hikes were seen as a significant factor in the growth outlook, as respondents considered there to be risks on both sides: easing too early, combined with inflation being more persistent than expected, carried the risk of an upward price spiral, while at the same time there was a risk of overtightening. Longer-term growth expectations (which refer to 2028) stood at 1.3%, down from 1.4% (for 2027) in the previous survey round.
Chart 6
Expectations for real GDP growth
(annual percentage changes)
The profile of respondents’ short-term GDP outlook (from the second quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024) implies a modest, but constant, increase in economic activity over this period.
[
5
]
Actual quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for the first quarter of 2023 was -0.1% and thus less than the forecast of 0.0% in the previous SPF round. In this round, forecasters expected average quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.2% from the second quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 (see Chart 7). Compared with the last survey round, the share of forecasters that expected at least one quarter of negative growth over the next four quarters fell to 23% (from 35%), and the share forecasting a “technical recession” (i.e. two consecutive quarters of negative growth) over this period declined to 7% (from 11%). In comparison with the June 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, SPF forecasts indicate a more conservative outlook for the period between the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, predicting a quarter-on-quarter growth rate that is 0.1 percentage points lower, on average, across the four quarters.
Chart 7
Expected profile of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth
(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes)
Note: Grey area indicates one standard deviation (of individual expectations) around average SPF expectations.
The profile for the expected level of economic activity implied by the real GDP growth rates has been revised down only slightly compared to the previous survey round. However, it remains substantially below the profile seen in the round prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Compared with the survey round for the first quarter of 2022 (conducted in early January and before the Russian invasion of Ukraine), the expected level of real GDP in 2026 has been revised down by around 3.0% (see Chart 8). Prior to the war in Ukraine, GDP was expected to surpass the profile expected pre-pandemic in the course of 2023. Now the level of GDP is expected to remain below that profile until at least 2028. Expected GDP levels in 2024 and 2025 are also lower than implied by the June 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections (by 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively).
Chart 8
Forecast profile of real GDP
(index: 2019 = 100)
Note: Growth expectations for years not surveyed have been interpolated linearly.
Quantitative measures of uncertainty surrounding the growth outlook remained on similar levels as in the previous survey round, while the balance of risks decreased sharply at the two-year horizon (see Chart 9 and Chart 10). Aggregate uncertainty was unchanged at the two-years-ahead and longer-term horizons, remaining above the levels which prevailed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was still considerably lower than at its peak in the second and third quarters of 2020. The balance of risks fell substantially for the two-years-ahead horizon, moving to levels below zero. For the longer-term horizon, it remained positive, with a slight upward movement compared with the previous round.

In the ECB SPF round in the third quarter of 2023, longer-term expectations referred to 2028. In the prior two rounds they referred to 2027.
4 Unemployment rate expectations revised downward slightly for 2023 and 2024, but unchanged for the longer term
In the third quarter of 2023, respondents expected unemployment rates of 6.6%, 6.7% and 6.7% for 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively. These were revised downward from the previous survey round by 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points for 2023 and 2024, and revised upward by 0.1 percentage points for 2025. The expectation for long-term unemployment (2028) was 6.5%, unchanged from the previous round (which asked about 2027) and still close to the historical low of 6.4%. After increases in 2023 and 2024, the unemployment rate was expected to follow a downward-sloping trajectory, similar to what was observed in the previous round (see Chart 11). Respondents reported that the main factors for their downward revisions in the short term were a more robust labour market than could have been expected on the basis of economic activity, large businesses’ hiring intentions and job retention. Looking ahead, employment growth was expected to be weaker in 2024 and 2025 than in 2023, mainly due to modest economic growth expectations. In this context, if economic activity were to be disappointing, respondents considered that firms might first act along the intensive margin (hours). Nevertheless, they mentioned weaker than expected economic growth as an upside risk for unemployment.
Chart 11
Expectations for the unemployment rate
(percentages of the labour force)
The level of uncertainty regarding short and long-term unemployment rate expectations increased, remaining at relatively high levels. “Aggregate uncertainty” has fluctuated around elevated levels (higher than those prevailing before the pandemic) in recent survey rounds. Generally, the quantitative balance of risks indicator was slightly positive for most horizons (except for two years ahead, where it was approximately neutral) and, on balance, the aggregate probability distributions exhibited somewhat positive skewness (see Chart 12 and Chart 13). For longer-term unemployment rate expectations, the balance of risks indicator was marginally positive, with the mean of the aggregate probability distribution (6.7%) above the average point forecast (6.5%).

5 Expectations for other variables
Forecasters expected the rate on the ECB’s main refinancing operations (MROs) to increase to 4.25% in the third quarter of 2023 and to remain at this level up to the second quarter of 2024, before easing in the second half of 2024 and further in 2025, falling to 3.25%. They expected the euro to appreciate marginally against the US dollar and oil prices to remain in a narrow range just above USD 77 per barrel. And they expected nominal wage growth to increase in 2023 before moderating in subsequent years.
Respondents expected the ECB’s MRO interest rate to increase to 4.25% in the third quarter of 2023. They expected it to remain around this level for the remainder of 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024, before declining slightly in the second half of 2024 and falling to 3.25% in 2025 (see Chart 14a). While the peak average expectation was 4.33% (previously 4.04%) for the fourth quarter of 2023, it was relatively balanced among respondents who expected the rate to be either 4.25% or 4.5%. Compared with the previous survey round, the profile of the entire horizon was revised up by around 0.25 percentage points.
The expected average USD/EUR exchange rate was broadly consistent with expectations from the previous survey round of levels between 1.09 and 1.11 in 2023 and 2024, but with a slight downward revision from 1.13 to 1.12 in 2025 (see Chart 14b).
Compared with the previous round, expected US dollar-denominated oil prices were revised downward for the entire horizon. This represents a downward level shift as respondents still envisaged a relatively flat trajectory similar to the previous survey round, but now with lower levels of between USD 77 and USD 78 per barrel up to 2025 (see Chart 14c).
Expectations for annual growth in compensation per employee were 5.4% for 2023, 4.1% for 2024 and 3.4% for 2025. For the longer term they were 3.0%. This implied upward revisions of 0.4 percentage points for 2023, 0.1 percentage points for 2024 and 0.2 percentage points for 2025 (see Chart 14d).

Minimum reserves to be remunerated at 0%
Change preserves the effectiveness and improves the efficiency of monetary policy
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at 0%. The change will become effective as of the beginning of the reserve maintenance period starting on 20 September 2023.
Minimum reserves are reserve balances that credit institutions are required to hold with their Eurosystem national central bank on average over a maintenance period. Credit institutions are required to hold a minimum amount equivalent to 1% of specific liabilities, mainly customers’ deposits. Minimum reserves are currently remunerated at the ECB’s deposit facility rate (DFR).
In the current conditions of ample liquidity, the interest paid on the reserves that banks hold in the ECB’s deposit facility – i.e. reserves beyond the minimum required level – is the Governing Council’s main instrument for setting the monetary policy stance in its fight against inflation. Today’s decision to reduce the remuneration on minimum reserves will preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy by maintaining the current degree of control over the monetary policy stance and ensuring the full pass-through of the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions to money markets. At the same time, it will improve the efficiency of monetary policy by reducing the overall amount of interest that needs to be paid on reserves in order to implement the appropriate stance.
In October last year, the Governing Council decided to reduce the remuneration of minimum reserves from the rate on the main refinancing operations (MRO rate) to the DFR.

]
That change aligned minimum reserve remuneration more closely with short-term money market rates. Since then, the efficiency aspect has risen in relevance, in line with the higher level of the key ECB interest rates.
Today’s decision does not prejudge the outcome of the ongoing review of the ECB’s operational framework.

Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.
The rate increase today reflects the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The developments since the last meeting support the expectation that inflation will drop further over the remainder of the year but will stay above target for an extended period. While some measures show signs of easing, underlying inflation remains high overall. The past rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully: financing conditions have tightened again and are increasingly dampening demand, which is an important factor in bringing inflation back to target.
The Governing Council’s future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council also decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at 0%. This decision will preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy by maintaining the current degree of control over the monetary policy stance and ensuring the full pass-through of the interest rate decisions to money markets. At the same time, it will improve the efficiency of monetary policy by reducing the overall amount of interest that needs to be paid on reserves in order to implement the appropriate stance.
The details of the change to the remuneration of minimum reserves are provided in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 4.25%, 4.50% and 3.75% respectively, with effect from 2 August 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.

Credit standards tightened further for all loan categories
Demand for loans decreased strongly for both firms and households
Banks more concerned about non-performing loans, set to tighten lending conditions
Climate risks increasingly reflected in lending conditions
According to the July 2023 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further in the second quarter of 2023. The net percentage of banks reporting a tightening was smaller than in the previous quarter, standing at 14%, compared with 27% in the first quarter (Chart 1), in line with what banks had expected. The cumulated net tightening since the beginning of 2022 has been substantial, and the BLS results have provided early indications about the significant weakening in lending dynamics observed since last autumn. Banks also reported a further net tightening of their credit standards for loans to households for house purchase and consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentages of 8% and 18% respectively). For households, the net tightening was less pronounced than in the previous quarter for housing loans, while it was more pronounced for consumer credit. Higher risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and borrower-specific situation, lower risk tolerance as well as banks’ higher cost of funds contributed to the tightening. For the third quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, albeit more moderate, net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, and unchanged credit standards on loans to households for house purchase. For consumer credit, euro area banks expect a minor net tightening of credit standards.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened further for loans to firms and loans to households in the second quarter of 2023. Widening loan margins and rising interest rates accounted for the main tightening effect, reflecting the ongoing pass-through of higher market rates to lending rates for firms and households.
Banks reported a strong net decrease in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the second quarter of 2023, which dropped to an all-time low since the start of the survey in 2003 (Chart 2). The net decrease was again substantially stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. Rising interest rates and lower financing needs for fixed investment were the main drivers of reduced loan demand. For the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decline in demand for loans to firms, albeit much smaller than in the second quarter. Euro area banks also reported a strong net decrease in demand for housing loans which, however, was lower than the very large net decrease in the previous two quarters. Higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence all contributed negatively to the demand for loans for house purchase. There was also a net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, driven mainly by rising interest rates and low consumer confidence. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, although markedly less pronounced, net decrease in housing loan demand, and a somewhat smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to funding deteriorated in most market segments in the second quarter of 2023, especially for retail funding. The reported net deterioration in access to retail funding may reflect increased competition for retail deposits in the current environment of higher interest rates and outflows of overnight deposits. For debt securities, the deterioration reflects somewhat higher bank bond yields compared with the end of the first quarter, while access to money markets remained broadly unchanged.
Euro area banks reported a net tightening impact of non-performing loan (NPL) ratios on their lending conditions for loans to enterprises and consumer credit in the first half of 2023. NPL ratios had a broadly neutral impact for housing loans. Banks referred to higher risk perceptions and their lower risk tolerance as main factors behind the contribution of NPL ratios to tightening lending conditions.
Credit standards for new loans to enterprises tightened further across all main sectors of economic activity in the first half of 2023, especially for commercial real estate. Credit standards also tightened substantially in the energy-intensive manufacturing sector, although considerably less than in the second half of last year. The net percentage of banks reporting this development was broadly in line with other sectors like residential real estate, construction, and wholesale and retail trade. The net tightening was relatively lower in the services sector. In addition, euro area banks reported a net decrease in demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, which was especially strong in the real estate sector.
The July 2023 survey questionnaire included a new annual ad hoc question aimed at gauging the impact of climate change on bank lending to enterprises. Euro area banks indicated that climate risks of euro area firms and measures to cope with climate change had a net tightening impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to brown firms over the past 12 months, while they had a net easing impact for loans to green firms and firms in transition (see Notes). Euro area banks also reported a net increase in demand for loans to firms owing to climate-related risks and opportunities over the past 12 months, driven by firms in transition and green firms, while brown firms showed a net decrease in loan demand. The main driver of loan demand related to climate risks was financing needs for fixed investment and corporate restructuring.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the July 2023 survey relate to changes observed in the second quarter of 2023 and expected changes in the third quarter of 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The July 2023 survey round was conducted between 19 June and 4 July 2023. A total of 158 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

,"Introduction
The results reported in the July 2023 bank lending survey (BLS) relate to changes observed during the second quarter of 2023 and expectations for the third quarter of 2023. The survey was conducted between 19 June and 4 July 2023. A total of 158 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%. In addition to results for the euro area as a whole, this report contains results for the four largest euro area countries.
[

]
A number of ad hoc questions were included in the July 2023 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios on their lending policies, the change in bank lending conditions and loan demand across the main economic sectors, and the impact of climate change on bank lending to enterprises.
1 Overview of results
In the July 2023 BLS, euro area banks reported that their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further in the second quarter of 2023, although the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening was smaller than in the previous quarter (see Overview table). The net tightening was in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter, remaining above the historical average since the start of the survey in 2003. The cumulated net tightening since the beginning of 2022 has been substantial, and the BLS results have provided early indications about the significant weakening in lending dynamics observed since last autumn. Against the background of the typical lags in the impact of monetary policy transmission on the economy, risks related to the economic outlook and firm-specific situations remained the main driver of the tightening of credit standards for firms. Banks’ lower risk tolerance and their cost of funds and balance sheet situation also contributed to the tightening, reflecting higher credit risks in the context of rising interest rates and weak economic growth. In the third quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms, but at a slower pace than in the second quarter.
Banks reported a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to households in the second quarter of 2023. The net tightening was less pronounced than in the previous quarter for housing loans, while it was more pronounced for consumer credit. The net tightening for housing loans was broadly in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter, while it was more pronounced than expected for consumer credit. Higher risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and borrower-specific situation, lower risk tolerance as well as higher cost of funds contributed to the tightening. In the third quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect credit standards to remain unchanged for households for house purchase, while a further net tightening is expected for consumer credit and other loans to households, although to a lesser extent than in the second quarter.
Firms’ net demand for loans fell strongly in the second quarter of 2023, dropping to an all-time low since the start of the survey in 2003. The decline in net demand reflects the impact of rising interest rates on loan demand and economic growth. Fixed investment also had a strong dampening impact on loan demand, mirrored by a strong net decrease in demand for long-term loans. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decrease in demand for loans to firms, but much smaller than in the second quarter.
Euro area banks also reported a strong net decrease in demand for housing loans which, however, was lower than the very large net decrease in the previous two quarters. Higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence all contributed negatively to the demand for loans for house purchase. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, although markedly less pronounced, net decrease in housing loan demand, and a further net decrease in demand for consumer credit.
The July 2023 BLS contained a number of ad hoc questions. Euro area banks reported that their access to funding deteriorated in most market segments in the second quarter of 2023, especially in retail funding. Euro area banks reported a net tightening impact of NPL ratios on their lending conditions for loans to enterprises and consumer credit in the first half of 2023. Credit standards for new loans to enterprises tightened further across all main sectors of economic activity in the first half of 2023, especially for commercial real estate. The July 2023 survey questionnaire also included a new annual ad hoc question aimed at gauging the impact of climate change on bank lending to enterprises. Euro area banks indicated that climate risks of euro area firms and measures to cope with climate change had a net tightening impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to brown firms over the past 12 months, while they had a net easing impact for loans to green firms and firms in transition.
In more detail, euro area banks further tightened their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) in net terms for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the second quarter of 2023, although the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening was smaller than in the previous quarter (net percentage of banks of 14%, after 27% in the previous quarter; see Overview table). The net tightening was in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter, remaining above the historical average since the start of the survey (9%; see Overview table). The cumulated net tightening since the beginning of 2022 has been substantial, and the BLS results have provided early indications about the significant weakening in lending dynamics observed since last autumn. Against the background of the typical lags in the impact of monetary policy transmission on the economy, banks’ risk perceptions continued to have the largest tightening impact, while banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed, reflecting higher credit risks in the context of rising interest rates and weak economic growth. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also contributed to the tightening, mainly owing to higher capital costs and banks’ lower liquidity position. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms, but at a slower pace than in the second quarter (net percentage of 10%).
Euro area banks reported a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to households in the second quarter of 2023, which was less pronounced than in the previous quarter for housing loans (net percentage of banks of 8%, after 19% in the previous quarter; see Overview table) and more pronounced for consumer credit (18%, after 10%). For housing loans, the net tightening was broadly in line with banks’ expectations in the previous quarter (expected net percentage of 6%) and remained slightly above its historical average (6%, see Overview table). For consumer credit, meanwhile, the net tightening was substantially higher than banks’ expectations (expected net percentage of 12%) and clearly above its historical average (5%). The main drivers of the tightening for both housing loans and consumer credit were higher risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance and, to a lesser extent, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints. Competition contributed somewhat to alleviating the net tightening pressures. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect unchanged credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of 0%). For consumer credit, a further net tightening is expected (net percentage of 2%), although to a lesser extent than in the previous quarter.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to firms and households tightened further. For firms, the difference between the percentage of banks reporting a tightening and the percentage of banks reporting an easing was still substantial and similar to the last quarter (net percentage of 23%, after 24%). Margins on average and riskier loans widened in the context of the pass-through of higher policy rates to lending rates, alongside with collateral requirements, which had a small net tightening impact on terms and conditions for firms. Banks also referred to “other factors”, mainly in relation to higher lending rates. In addition, banks reported a further net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans, albeit at a slower pace (net percentage of 15%, after 26%) and a somewhat higher net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (21%, after 18%). For both, the tightening was mainly on account of widening margins on riskier loans and average loans reflecting the proceeding pass-through of higher market rates to mortgage rates and consumer credit rates.
In the second quarter of 2023, banks reported a further net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 16%, after 15%). Banks mentioned more often, in net terms, an increase in the share of rejected loans for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than for large firms. Euro area banks reported a further net increase in the share of rejected applications also for loans to households, which was lower than the previous quarter for housing loans (8%, after 17%) and similar to the previous quarter for consumer credit (10%).
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in net terms in all four of the largest euro area countries in the second quarter of 2023 (see Overview table). Credit standards for housing loans and credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in Germany, France and Spain while they remained unchanged in Italy.
Firms’ net demand for loans decreased strongly in the second quarter of 2023 (net percentage of -42%, after -38% in the previous quarter; see Overview table), dropping to an all-time low since the start of the survey in 2003. The decline was again substantially stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. The general level of interest rates and fixed investment remained the main driver of reduced loan demand, reflecting the dampening impact of rising interest rates on loan demand and economic growth. Mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity (included in “other financing needs”) and available internal funding (included in “use of alternative finance”), reflecting corporate profits, also dampened loan demand. There was also a marginal dampening impact on loan demand from inventories and working capital. The decrease in loan demand was very strong in historical perspective for both long-term and short-term loans. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decrease in demand for loans to firms, but much smaller than in the second quarter (net percentage of -6%).
The net decrease in demand for housing loans remained strong in the second quarter of 2023 but was lower than the sharp net decrease in the previous two quarters (net percentage of -47%, after -72% and -74% in the first quarter of 2023 and in the fourth quarter of 2022 respectively; see Overview table). The decrease in the second quarter was relatively close to the value expected by banks in the previous quarter. Higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence all contributed negatively to the demand for loans for house purchase. The net decrease in demand for consumer credit also became smaller (net percentage of -12%, after -19%, see Overview table), broadly in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter. Here, to a smaller extent than in the first quarter of 2023, low consumer confidence and spending on durable goods contributed to lower demand, whereas higher interest rates had a similarly large dampening impact on demand for consumer credit as in the previous quarter. In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, although markedly less pronounced, net decrease in housing loan demand (net percentage of -18%), and a further net decrease in demand for consumer credit, albeit somewhat smaller (-8%) than in the second quarter.
Banks reported a substantial net decrease in demand for loans to enterprises across all four largest euro area countries in the second quarter of 2023. Net demand for housing loans continued to decrease substantially in all four largest euro area countries. Demand for consumer credit decreased in net terms in all four largest euro area countries to a comparable degree.

Latest BLS results for the largest euro area countries
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards or an increase in loan demand)
Notes: “Avg.” refers to historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.
Euro area banks reported that their access to funding deteriorated in most market segments in the second quarter of 2023, especially in retail funding. The reported net deterioration in access to retail funding may reflect increased competition for retail deposits in the current environment of increasing remuneration of deposits and outflows of overnight deposits. This is confirmed by the pronounced deterioration in access to short-term retail funding (14% in net terms, the highest since the first quarter of 2012). For debt securities, the deterioration reflects somewhat higher bank bond yields compared with the end of the first quarter, while access to money markets remained broadly unchanged. In the third quarter of 2023, access to retail funding and to all sources of wholesale funding is expected to deteriorate somewhat.
Euro area banks reported a net tightening impact of NPL ratios on their credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to enterprises and consumer credit in the first half of 2023 (credit standards: net percentages of 6%, after 1%, and 7%, after -1% respectively). By contrast, NPL ratios had a neutral impact for housing loans (credit standards: net percentage of 0% after 0%). Banks referred to higher risk perceptions and their lower risk tolerance as the main factors behind the contribution of NPL ratios to tightening lending conditions, possibly reflecting increased refinancing and repayment risks in the context of rising interest rates and the dampening impact of high inflation and lower economic growth on real disposable income. In the second half of 2023, euro area banks expect the net tightening impact of NPL ratios across all loan categories to be similar to the developments in the first half of the year.
Credit standards for new loans to enterprises tightened further across all main sectors of economic activity in the first half of 2023, especially for commercial real estate (net percentage of 30%, after 25%). Credit standards also tightened substantially in the energy-intensive manufacturing sector, although considerably less than in the second half of last year. The net percentage of banks reporting this development was broadly in line with other sectors like residential real estate, construction and wholesale and retail trade. The net tightening was relatively lower in the services sector. Euro area banks reported a net decrease in demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, which was especially strong in the real estate sectors (net percentages of -42%, after -23%, and -41%, after -36%, in commercial real estate and residential real estate respectively). In the second half of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, but smaller net tightening in credit standards for loans to firms across all main economic sectors. Banks expect a further, but smaller net decrease in loan demand across all main economic sectors.
Climate risks of euro area firms and measures to cope with climate change had a net tightening impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to brown firms over the past 12 months (net percentages of 39% and 17% respectively), while they had a net easing impact for loans to green firms and firms in transition (credit standards: net percentage of -15% and -7% respectively; terms and conditions: net percentages of -23% and -17% respectively). Firm-specific climate-related transition risks were the main driver of the tightening impact on banks’ lending policy, whereas physical risk, often related to the geographical location of the borrower, had on average a somewhat smaller net tightening impact, and climate-related fiscal support helped to ease loan approval. Euro area banks reported a net increase in demand for loans to firms owing to climate-related risks over the past 12 months, driven by firms in transition and green firms, while brown firms showed a net decrease in loan demand. The main driver of loan demand related to climate risks was fixed investment and corporate restructuring, pointing to investment needs of firms on the way to a more sustainable economy. Over the next 12 months, euro area banks expect a stronger net tightening impact owing to climate risks on credit standards for loans to brown firms, while a net easing impact is expected for green firms and firms in transition. In addition, euro area banks expect that the impact of climate risks on loan demand will become stronger in net terms.

General notes
The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 158 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.
[

]
BLS questionnaire
The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e. domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat, or (5) eased/increased considerably.
In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).
Aggregation of banks’ replies to national and euro area BLS results
The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.
In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.
[

]
For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.
In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares in lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.
BLS indicators
Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e. they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.
[
4
]
The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.
A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).
Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e. an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.
In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.
In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.
Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via the ECB Data Portal.
A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on the ECB's website.
2 Developments in credit standards, terms and conditions, and net demand for loans in the euro area
2.1 Loans to enterprises
2.1.1 Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened further
Euro area banks tightened their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises further in the second quarter of 2023, although the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening was smaller than in the previous quarter (net percentage of banks of 14%, after 27% in the first quarter of 2023; see Chart 1 and Overview table).
[
5
]
The net tightening was in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter (net percentage of 15%), remaining above the historical average since the start of the survey in 2003 (9%; see Overview table). The cumulated net tightening since the beginning of 2022 has been substantial, and the BLS results have provided early indications about the significant weakening in lending dynamics observed since last autumn.
[
6
]
Credit standards tightened somewhat more in net terms for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 17%, after 23%) than for loans to large firms (13%, after 24%; see Chart 2). In addition, the tightening was stronger for long-term loans (15%, after 28%) than for short-term loans (10%, after 17%).
Against the background of the typical lags in the impact of monetary policy transmission on the economy, banks’ risk perceptions continued to have the largest tightening impact, while banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed (see Chart 1 and Table 1). Risks related to the economic outlook and firm-specific situations remained the main driver of the tightening of credit standards for firms, reflecting higher credit risks in the context of rising interest rates and weak economic growth, while banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed to the tightening. Risks related to the economic situation are also signalled by the composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro area, which declined at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also contributed to the tightening of credit standards, mainly owing to higher capital costs and banks’ lower liquidity position, while its net tightening contribution remained contained compared with earlier tightening periods. The factors contributing to changes in credit standards were similar for SMEs and large enterprises.

(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Chart 2
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened across all four largest euro area countries. Higher risk perceptions and declining risk tolerance had a tightening impact in all four countries. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a tightening contribution in France and Spain, while banks reported a neutral impact of this factor on the change in credit standards in the second quarter in Germany and Italy.
In the third quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms (net percentage of 10%). The further tightening would happen at a slower pace than in the second quarter and be around the historical average since the start of the survey. Banks expect this development for both loans to large firms (net percentage of 9%) and for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 13%).
Table 1
Factors contributing to changes in credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
2.1.2 Terms and conditions on loans to enterprises tightened further
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened further in the second quarter of 2023, at a similar pace as in the previous quarter (net percentage of 23%, after 24%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). Tighter terms and conditions were mainly driven by widening loan margins (defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates), reflecting the ongoing pass-through of ECB rate hikes to lending rates. The net widening of margins on riskier loans to firms (net percentage of 23%) remained stronger than for average loans (net percentage of 18%), although the net widening of margins on average loans increased considerably compared with the previous quarter. Collateral requirements and “other terms and conditions” (mainly related to loan size and maturity) also had a small net tightening impact, in line with banks’ lower risk tolerance. Banks also referred to “other factors” having a tightening impact, mainly in relation to higher funding costs and lending rates. Banks reported a further net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to SMEs and large firms (net percentage for both at 19%; see Chart 4). For both categories of lending, loan margins widened somewhat more for riskier loans than for average loans.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “non-interest rate charges”, “size of the loan or credit line”, “loan covenants” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions, lower risk tolerance and the cost of funds and balance sheet situation continued to be the main drivers of the net tightening in overall terms and conditions for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2023 (see Table 3). Risk perceptions, related to the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of the firms, had the largest tightening impact on terms and conditions. In addition, in the context of continued increases in bank funding costs and decreases in bank liquidity, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed towards the tightening.

Chart 4
Changes in terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Note: See the notes to Chart 3.
In all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions tightened on loans or credit lines to enterprises. In Germany, Spain and France, the net tightening was mainly driven by widening loan margins. Meanwhile, in Italy, banks referred to “other terms and conditions”, especially to the size of the loan or credit line, as the main tightening factor for terms and conditions. Tighter collateral requirements and the higher level of interest rates (mentioned in the “other factors”) also contributed to the tightening in most of the countries.
Table 3
Factors contributing to changes in overall terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. See the notes to Chart 1.
2.1.3 Rejection rate for loans to enterprises increased
In the second quarter of 2023, banks reported a further net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 16%, after 15% in the previous quarter; see Chart 5). Banks mentioned more often, in net terms, an increase in the share of rejected loans for SMEs than for large firms (net percentages of 15% and 9% respectively).

Changes in the share of rejected loan applications for enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase)
Notes: Share of rejected loan applications relative to the volume of all loan applications in that loan category. The breakdown by firm sizes was introduced in the first quarter of 2022.
In all four largest euro area countries, banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2023. The share of rejected loan applications increased in net terms for loans to SMEs in all four countries. For loans to large firms, it increased in Germany and Spain, whereas it remained unchanged in France and Italy.
2.1.4 Net demand for loans to enterprises decreased strongly
Euro area firms’ net demand for loans decreased strongly in the second quarter of 2023 (net percentage of -42%, after -38% in the previous quarter; see Chart 6), dropping to an all-time low since the start of the survey in 2003.
[

]
The decline was again substantially stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. The net decrease in loan demand was the strongest since the start of the survey in 2003 for SMEs (net percentage of -40%, see Chart 7), while the net decrease in demand for loans to large firms (net percentage of -34%) remained slightly more limited than during the global financial crisis. In addition, the net decrease in demand was the strongest over the history of the survey for long-term loans (-46%), while demand for short-term loans decreased to a lesser extent (-22%) but still close to the historical low of the global financial crisis.
Chart 6
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.
Chart 7
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 6. Developments in the factors having an impact on loan demand across firm sizes were added in the first quarter of 2022.
Rising interest rates and declining fixed investment remained the main drivers of the net decrease in loan demand (see Chart 6 and Table 4). Lower financing needs for M&A activity (included in “other financing needs”), available internal funding with improved corporate profits, and, to a smaller extent, debt securities issuance (included in “use of alternative finance”) contributed to firms’ reduced loan demand. There was also a small dampening impact on loan demand from inventories and working capital. For both SMEs and large firms, the general level of interest rates and firms’ financing needs for fixed investment were the main drivers of reduced loan demand (see Chart 7).
Table 4
Factors contributing to changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 6.
Demand for loans to firms declined strongly in all four largest euro area countries. In line with the euro area aggregate, higher interest rates and lower financing needs for fixed investment were the main drivers of reduced loan demand in all four countries. Lower M&A activity also had a notable negative impact on loan demand in all four largest countries. Regarding alternative funding sources, the availability of firms’ internal funds was reported as reducing loan demand especially by banks in Italy and, to a smaller extent, by banks in Spain and Germany, while the issuance of debt securities was quoted as a small dampening factor for corporate loan demand by banks in France and Germany.
In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decrease in demand for loans to firms, but much smaller than in the second quarter (net percentage of -6%). Since the end of 2022, banks have tended to have too positive expectations on loan demand, which suggests that expectations for the third quarter could also be too optimistic. Banks expect that the pace of decrease in loan demand will become lower both for short-term and long-term loan demand in the third quarter (net percentages of -2% and -12% respectively).
2.2 Loans to households for house purchase
2.2.1 Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened further
In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks reported a further net tightening of credit standards on loans to households for house purchase, which was less pronounced than in the previous quarter (net percentage of banks at 8%, after 19% in the first quarter of 2023). The net tightening was broadly in line with the tightening expected by the banks in the first quarter of 2023 and continued to be at a level slightly above the historical average of 6% (see Chart 8 and Overview table).
Chart 8
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “housing market prospects, including expected house price developments” and “borrower’s creditworthiness”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions were the main factor driving the net tightening of credit standards on housing loans, albeit to a lesser extent than in the previous quarter (see Chart 8 and Table 5). This was related to a similar extent to banks’ concerns regarding borrowers’ creditworthiness, housing market prospects and the general economic outlook. In addition, banks’ lower risk tolerance continued to contribute to the tightening. To a similar extent, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints also contributed to the tightening. It predominantly related to higher capital costs while the impact of banks’ liquidity position and access to market financing was broadly neutral in the second quarter.
In most of the four largest euro area countries, credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened in net terms. Banks’ risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance were the main drivers of the net tightening. Banks in Spain and France particularly referred to a tightening impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation, either due to their market financing conditions and liquidity positions (Spain) or capital costs (France). In Italy, credit standards on housing loans remained unchanged in the second quarter.
In the third quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect unchanged credit standards on loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of 0%).
Table 5
Factors contributing to changes in credit standards for loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 8.
2.2.2 Terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase tightened further
Banks reported a further net tightening of their overall terms and conditions for new housing loans in the second quarter of 2023, albeit less pronounced than in the previous quarter (net percentage of 15%, after 26% in the previous quarter; see Chart 9 and Table 6). The net tightening of banks’ overall terms and conditions was mainly on account of widening margins on both average and riskier loans, reflecting the proceeding pass-through of higher market rates to mortgage rates and concerns or varying attitudes towards credit risks.
Chart 9
Changes in terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “loan-to-value ratio”, “other loan size limits”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Table 6
Changes in terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 9.
Banks’ higher cost of funds and balance sheet situation contributed most to the net tightening of overall terms and conditions, while the tightening impact of banks’ risk perceptions became smaller (see Table 7). In addition, banks mentioned the following “other factors” as contributors to the tightening of their overall terms and conditions: the level of interest rates, higher market reference rates to which mortgage loans are linked, and the increase in the usury rate in France, although to a lesser extent than in previous quarters (see the country developments below).
[
8
]
By contrast, competition had a small net easing impact on terms and conditions.
In most of the largest euro area economies, overall terms and conditions for housing loans tightened in net terms. In Germany, France and Spain, the widening of loan margins contributed most to tighter overall terms and conditions, while in Italy overall terms and conditions remained unchanged as the rising level of interest rates (included in “other factors”) was compensated by decreasing margins on both average and riskier loans. Banks in France referred to the update of the administrative threshold for a lending rate to be classified as usury rate (part of “other factors”), for which the adjustment was temporarily changed from quarterly to monthly for the rates applicable from 1 February to 1 July to smoothen the adjustment of rate increases (see footnote 8). This allowed banks in France to increase the pass-through of ECB rate hikes to mortgage rates, as reflected in widening loan margins in the first and second quarters of 2023, after several quarters in which banks in France had reported a narrowing of loan margins due to the legal constraint of the usury rate. The dominant factor contributing to the tightening of overall terms and conditions in France was banks’ funding costs, whereas higher risk perceptions were the dominant tightening factor in Spain. Both factors had a net tightening impact in Germany and Italy alongside with a lower risk tolerance of banks in Italy. Competition had an easing impact in Germany and Italy.
Table 7
Factors contributing to changes in overall terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.2.3 Rejection rate for housing loans increased
In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks reported a further net increase in the share of rejected applications for housing loans, albeit lower than in the previous quarter (net percentage of 8%, after 17%; see Chart 10). Banks in Germany, Spain and France reported a net increase in the percentage share of rejected loan applications, whereas banks in Italy reported a net decrease in the share of rejected loan applications.

(net percentages of banks reporting an increase)
Notes: Share of rejected loan applications relative to the volume of all loan applications in that loan category.
2.2.4 Net demand for housing loans decreased strongly
The net decrease in demand for housing loans remained strong in the second quarter of 2023 but was lower than the sharp net decrease in the previous two quarters (net percentage of banks of -47%, after -72% in the first quarter of 2023 and -74% and the fourth quarter of 2022; see Chart 11 and Overview table). The decrease in demand in the second quarter 2023 was relatively close to the value expected by banks in the previous quarter (net percentage of -39%).
Chart 11
Changes in demand for loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation” and “regulatory and fiscal regime of housing markets”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal finance of house purchase out of savings/down payment”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”.
Higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence all contributed negatively to the demand for loans for house purchase (see Chart 11 and Table 8). For the fourth quarter in a row, the general level of interest rates remained the main negative contributor to housing loan demand. The negative impact of consumer confidence and housing market prospects was again sizeable in the second quarter of 2023, but was smaller than in the previous quarter, remaining largely less negative than the extreme values during the global financial crisis. The development of these factors is in line with the current environment of considerable rises in mortgage rates for euro area households and falling euro area house prices. Additionally, the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator remained well below its long-term average for the euro area up to June, although it had been recovering in the last quarter as households started revising their inflation expectations and became more optimistic about their own financial situation. To a small extent, other financing needs and the use of alternative finance, mainly households’ savings, also contributed negatively to demand.
Demand for housing loans decreased substantially in all four largest euro area countries. The general level of interest rates, consumer confidence and housing market prospects all had a downward impact on demand in all four countries. Among these factors, rising interest rates had the strongest dampening impact in all countries. The negative impact of housing market prospects was larger in France than in Germany, Spain and Italy.
In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, although markedly less pronounced, decrease in housing loan demand (net percentage of banks of -18%).

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 11.
2.3 Consumer credit and other lending to households
2.3.1 Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened further
Banks reported a further net tightening of credit standards on consumer credit and other lending to households in the second quarter of 2023, which was more pronounced than in the previous quarter (net percentage of 18%, after 10% in the previous quarter; see Chart 12 and Overview table). The net tightening in credit standards was higher than banks’ expectations (net percentage of 12%) and above its historical average (5%).
Increased risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance mainly contributed to the net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit (see Chart 12 and Table 9). Banks’ perceptions of risks that affected their credit standards for consumer credit mainly related to the economic outlook and consumers’ creditworthiness. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions also contributed to the tightening, although to a lesser extent. Meanwhile, competition contributed to a minor easing of credit standards. Other factors, mainly relating to banks’ funding costs, also contributed to the tightening.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms in Germany, France and Spain, while they remained unchanged on balance in Italy. Higher risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance had a net tightening impact in all four countries, while banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation had a relevant tightening impact mainly in Spain, according to the banks. In France, higher deposit and other refinancing costs (included in “other factors”) were reported to have further contributed to the net tightening. By contrast, competitive pressures had a net easing impact on credit standards in Italy.
In the third quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a small further net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 2%).

2.3.2 Terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households tightened further
Banks’ overall terms and conditions applied when granting consumer credit and other lending to households tightened further in net terms in the second quarter of 2023 (net percentage of 21%, after 18% in the previous quarter; see Chart 13 and Table 10). Euro area banks referred mainly to widening margins on both average and riskier loans as contributing factors of the tightening in terms and conditions. To a smaller extent, the impact of rising interest rates and of increasing costs of deposits (both part of “other factors”) also contributed to the tightening.
Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed most to the net tightening of banks’ overall terms and conditions (see Table 11). Higher risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed to the tightening of overall terms and conditions, while competition had a net easing impact.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “size of the loan”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Across all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms in the second quarter of 2023. Banks in Germany, France and Spain reported a widening of loan margins, reflecting the pass-through of higher market rates to lending rates for consumers. By contrast, banks in Italy referred to a narrowing of loan margins in the second quarter, related to the further increase in the general level of interest rates (included in “other factors”) which had not yet been fully passed through to borrowers. In all the largest euro area countries, cost of funds and balance sheet constraints played a relevant role for the tightening of terms and conditions, while competition contributed to an easing in Spain.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.3.3 Rejection rate for consumer credit and other lending to households increased
Euro area banks reported the same net increase in the share of rejected applications for consumer credit and other lending to households in the second quarter of 2023 as in the first quarter (at 10%; see Chart 10 above). Across the largest euro area countries, the net increase in the share of rejected loan applications diminished in Germany and Spain, while it increased in France. In Italy, banks reported in net terms an unchanged share of loan rejections for consumer credit and other lending to households.
2.3.4 Net demand for consumer credit and other lending to households decreased at a smaller rate
In the second quarter of 2023, banks reported a net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households which, however, was smaller compared with the previous quarter (net percentage of banks at -12%, after -19% in the previous quarter; see Chart 14 and Overview table). This decline was broadly in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter (-16%).
Chart 14
Changes in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing out of savings”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”. “Consumption exp. (real estate)” denotes “consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans”.
Higher interest rates and low consumer confidence contributed most, in net terms (see Chart 14 and Table 12). Both factors had a smaller contribution towards the net decrease in demand relative to the previous quarter. These developments are consistent with the dampening impact of inflation on households’ real disposable income. The reduction in inflation rates may have played a role for the substantially smaller net decrease in loan demand for consumer durables. In addition, the downward but smaller impact of consumer confidence in the BLS is consistent with the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator, which remained below its long-term average but had been recovering in the second quarter.
Demand for consumer credit decreased in net terms in all four largest euro area countries, although in Italy to a lesser extent than in Germany, Spain and France. The general level of interest rates was the main factor contributing negatively towards demand in all four countries, while low consumer confidence had a significant negative impact in France and Spain, but less so in Italy and Germany. Spending on durable goods contributed negatively towards demand in Germany and France while it increased demand in Spain and Italy.
In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households but at a somewhat smaller pace than in the second quarter (net percentage of -8%).

3 Ad hoc questions
3.1 Banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding[9]
Euro area banks reported that their access to funding had deteriorated in most market segments in the second quarter of 2023, especially in retail funding. The reported net deterioration in access to retail funding (net percentage of 6%; see Chart 15) may reflect increased competition for retail deposits in the current environment of increasing remuneration of deposits and overnight deposit outflows. This is confirmed by the pronounced deterioration in access to short-term retail funding (14% in net terms, the highest since the first quarter of 2012). Ease of access to long-term retail funding remained broadly unchanged (net percentage of -1%). For debt securities (net percentage of banks at 5%), the deterioration reflects somewhat higher bank bond yields compared with the end of the first quarter and was related to long-term debt securities funding (net percentage of 9%), while access to short-term debt securities funding was assessed by banks as unchanged in the second quarter (net percentage of 0%). Banks also reported that access to money markets remained broadly unchanged (net percentage of -1%).
Chart 15
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in access)
Note: The net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “deteriorated considerably” and “deteriorated somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Table 13
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in access)
Note: See the notes to Chart 15.
In the third quarter of 2023, banks expect access to retail funding and to all sources of wholesale funding to deteriorate somewhat (net percentage of 3%, and between 3% and 5% respectively).
3.2 The impact of banks’ NPL ratios on their lending policies[10]
Euro area banks reported a net tightening impact of NPL ratios on their credit standards for loans to enterprises and consumer credit in the first half of 2023 (net percentages of 6%, after 1%, and 7%, after -1% respectively, see Chart 16). By contrast, NPL ratios had a neutral impact on credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of 0% after 0%), likely related to the collateralisation of mortgages. Banks also reported a net tightening impact of NPL ratios on their terms and conditions for loans to firms and consumer credit (6% and 10% respectively, see Chart 16) and a broadly neutral impact for housing loans (net percentage of 1%).
Banks referred to higher risk perceptions and their lower risk tolerance as the main factors behind the tightening impact of NPL ratios on lending conditions in the first half of 2023 (see Chart 17). This possibly reflects increased refinancing and repayment risks or a more cautious attitude towards existing risks, in the context of rising lending rates and the dampening impact of high inflation and lower economic growth on real disposable income. Pressure related to supervisory or regulatory requirements also contributed to the tightening impact via NPL ratios, whereas NPL ratios played on average only a small role for banks’ costs of capital, balance sheet situation and liquidity position in the first half of 2023, having therefore only a slight tightening impact on banks’ lending policy.
Chart 16
Impact of banks’ NPL ratios on credit standards and terms and conditions
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The NPL ratio is defined as the stock of gross NPLs on a bank’s balance sheet as a percentage of the gross carrying amount of loans. Changes in credit standards and/or terms and conditions can be caused by changes to the NPL ratio or by changes to regulations or the bank’s assessment of the level of the NPL ratio. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “contributed considerably to tightening” and “contributed somewhat to tightening” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “contributed somewhat to easing” and “contributed considerably to easing”. The dashed bars denote expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Chart 17
Contributions of factors through which NPL ratios affect banks’ policies on lending to enterprises and households
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 16.
Over the next six months, euro area banks expect the net tightening impact of NPL ratios across all loan categories to be similar to the developments in the first half of the year. Increased risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance are expected to remain the main drivers through which NPL ratios affect credit standards. Banks’ costs of capital and cost of balance sheet clean-up are expected to play a somewhat large role for the impact of NPL ratios on bank lending policies, suggesting that banks expect a larger relevance of NPLs in the coming months. The tightening impact via NPL ratios due to supervisory or regulatory requirements is expected to remain similar over the next six months.
3.3 Bank lending conditions and loan demand across main sectors of economic activity[11]
Credit standards for new loans to enterprises tightened further across all the main economic sectors in the first half of 2023, especially for commercial real estate (see Chart 18). Credit standards tightened most in the commercial real estate sector (net percentage of 30%, after 25% in the second half of 2022), against the background of falling house prices implying a decrease in commercial real estate collateral values. Related to the deteriorated situation in housing markets, the net tightening was also substantial in the residential real estate sector (19%, after 21%) and in the construction sector (18%, after 16%) in the first half of 2023. Credit risks also increased in the wholesale and retail trade sector (18%, after 14%). Credit standards also tightened further in the man"

Europeans invited to express preferences on shortlisted themes in public survey open until 31 August 2023
ECB’s Governing Council expected to choose future theme by 2024, and final designs in 2026
The European Central Bank (ECB) is asking European citizens about their views on the proposed themes for the next series of euro banknotes. From 10 July until 31 August 2023 everybody in the euro area can respond to a survey on the ECB’s website. In addition, to ensure opinions from across the euro area are equally represented, the ECB has contracted an independent research company to ask a representative sample of people in the euro area the same questions as those in its own survey.
ECB President Christine Lagarde invites everybody to participate in the survey. She said “There is a strong link between our single currency and our shared European identity, and our new series of banknotes should emphasise this. We want Europeans to identify with the design of euro banknotes, which is why they will play an active role in selecting the new theme.”
Developing our future euro banknotes
“We are working on a new series of high-tech banknotes with a view to preventing counterfeiting and reducing environmental impact,” said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. “We are committed to cash and to ensuring that paying with public money is always an option.”
It is the duty of the ECB and the euro area national central banks to ensure euro banknotes remain an innovative, secure and efficient means of payment. Developing new series of banknotes is a standard practice for all central banks. In a world where reproduction technologies are rapidly evolving and where counterfeiters can easily access information and materials, it is necessary to issue new banknotes on a regular basis. Beyond security considerations, the ECB is committed to reducing the environmental impact of euro banknotes throughout their life cycle, while also making them more relatable and inclusive for Europeans of all ages and backgrounds, including vulnerable groups such as people with visual impairment.
Shortlisted themes for future banknotes
The seven themes shortlisted by the ECB’s Governing Council are listed below.
[

]
Birds: free, resilient, inspiring
Birds know nothing of national borders and symbolise freedom of movement. Their nests remind us of our own desire to build places and societies that nurture and protect the future. They remind us that we share our continent with all the lifeforms that sustain our common existence.
European culture
Europe’s rich cultural heritage and dynamic cultural and creative sectors strengthen the European identity, forging a shared sense of belonging. Culture promotes common values, inclusion and dialogue in Europe and across the globe. It brings people together.
European values mirrored in nature
Europe is a living place, but also an idea. The European Union is an organisation, but also a set of values. The theme highlights the role of European values (human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights) as the building blocks of Europe and links these values to our respect for nature and the preservation of the environment.
The future is yours
The ideas and innovations that will shape the future of Europe lie deep within every European. The images created for this theme represent the bearers of the collective imagination through which people will create this shared future. This theme signifies the boundless potential of Europeans.
Hands: together we build Europe
Hands are familiar to all of us but no two pairs are the same. Hands built Europe, its physical infrastructure, its artistic heritage and its achievements. Hands build, weave, heal, teach, connect and guide us. Hands tell stories of labour, age and relationships, of heritage, history, and culture. This theme celebrates the hands that have built Europe and continue to do so every day. 
Our Europe, ourselves
We grow up as individuals but also as part of a community, through our relationships with one another. We have our own stories and identities, but we also share a common identity as Europeans. This theme evokes the freedom, values and openness of people in Europe.
Rivers: the waters of life in Europe
Europe's rivers cross borders. They connect us to each other and to nature. They represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic, ever-changing continent. They nurture us and remind us of the deep sources of our common life, and we must nurture them in turn.
The shortlist of themes takes into account the suggestions made by a multidisciplinary advisory group, with members from all euro area countries.
Timeline for the new designs
The outcome of the surveys will be used by the ECB to select the theme for the next generation of banknotes by 2024. After that a design competition will take place. European citizens will again have the chance to express their preferences on the design options resulting from that competition. The ECB is expected to take the decision on the future design, and on when to produce and issue the new banknotes, in 2026.

,"Executive summary
The Theme Advisory Group (TAG) is an independent and multidisciplinary group established in the second half of 2021 to advise on and propose a shortlist of new themes for future euro banknotes. Its members were appointed by the European Central Bank (ECB) based on proposals from euro area national central banks. The Group considered 29 themes in total – based on members’ own ideas and the public’s input – which were evaluated against certain criteria. The 29 themes considered, and the criteria used, are described in the report.
There was a broad consensus among TAG members that they should try to avoid suggesting motifs or narratives that draw too heavily upon any one national culture. Members also felt that themes should avoid the gender biases inherent in many representations of Europe’s past. There was a strong overall preference for imagery that could connect the banknotes to a dynamic Europe of people and nature over any undue emphasis on institutions or static symbols of the past. TAG members hoped to be able to propose themes that could convey a strong sense of shared European values while at the same time resonating powerfully with European citizens. Equally, TAG members, while highly conscious of the importance of contemporary events, acknowledged the need for the banknotes to be relevant and recognisable to those who will use them in decades to come.
A shortlist of six themes was produced following an internal voting procedure. The themes were ranked as follows, with the full support of the Group.
“European values mirrored in nature”
Description
The six banknotes feature the six values of the European Union as defined in the Treaty of Lisbon: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, and human rights. We will use visual imagery to convey a seventh value: our connection to, and respect for, our environment and the natural world.
Story
Europe is not only a living place, it is also an idea. And the EU is not just an organisation, but also a set of values.
We bring these values together with nature as components of the same underlying ethos. We reaffirm the role of European values as the building blocks of a Europe of the people, by the people, for the people. Sustainability and environmental preservation are then incorporated as a further fundamental value. These are European values, naturally.
Advantages
The two key ideas of this theme – European values and nature – were two of the most popular themes proposed in the focus groups.
European values are inclusive of all nations and people in Europe. The theme is timeless and transcends all borders.
Disadvantages
Given that values are somewhat abstract concepts, the success of this theme will greatly depend on the design chosen to represent the values. At the same time, representing these abstract yet extremely important concepts on the banknotes is quite a magical thing.
“Birds: free, resilient and inspiring”
Description
This theme is inspired by the EU Birds Directive, which aims to protect all of the 500 wild bird species in the EU. The Directive is one of the oldest pieces of EU legislation on the environment and exemplifies the shared responsibility and cooperation of the EU’s 27 Member States. It also reminds us of the need to share our continent with all life forms that sustain our common existence. These birds are real and vivid in themselves and also a symbol of our collective identity.
Story
Birds have always lived near humans, and by closely observing their appearance and behaviour over the centuries, we have learned a lot about the environment and ourselves.
Birds do not care about national borders so they have always symbolised freedom and aspiration. Their nests remind us of our own desire to build places and societies where we can nurture the future. In their songs we hear our own appreciation of free and beautiful expression. When they return with their seasonal migration, we feel hope. They enrich the world without depleting it – as we should too.
Advantages
This theme has a strong European dimension and a bold message for sustainability.
It creates an emotional connection and is legible, inclusive and timeless.
It lends itself to a visually pleasing and memorable design.
It reveals the diversity of Europe’s nature, landscapes and seasons.
Disadvantages
Some people do not like or are afraid of birds (ornithophobia).
Some other countries have birds on their banknotes.
“The future is yours”
Description
This theme creates “portraits” of Europeans of the future. The bearers of these banknotes are the bearers of the collective imagination in which people create their own, as yet undefined, possibilities.
This theme shows the boundless potential of Europeans and the dream to be portrayed on the banknote one day.
Story
The ideas and innovations that will determine Europe’s future lie deep within every European. Europe is shaped by your thoughts, your dreams, your skills and your inventions. The future is yours.
Advantages
It highlights innovation, ideas and new perspectives for Europe.
It connects the past to the present and the future.
It is inclusive and emotive.
Disadvantages
It could be seen as a theme for younger people.
It is very abstract.
“Rivers: the waters of life in Europe”
Description
This theme combines the public’s strong desire for banknotes that celebrate the natural wonders of Europe with a broader message about interconnectedness and sustainability.
Story
Europe’s rivers cross borders. They connect us to each other and to nature. They remind us of the deep sources of our common life and also represent the flow and flux of a dynamic, ever-changing continent. They nurture us and we must nurture them in return.
Advantages
This proposal includes the values that we share and should protect, but the theme is not abstract.
Rivers cross borders freely.
Rivers connect and facilitate trade.
Preserving nature is one of the most important goals of Europe and Europeans.
Timeless and natural beauty.
Disadvantages
No emotional connection.
Not strictly a European theme.
“Hands: together we build Europe”
Description
This theme creates a physical and easily understood representation of the six core values of the EU: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law and human rights. It also takes inspiration from the motto of the European Union: “United in diversity”. The human hand – familiar to us all but never the same in any two people – is used to make these abstract ideas feel more immediate and human.
Story
“Hands: together we build Europe” uses a universal language to celebrate diversity and unity. It represents everyone who has shaped Europe through our shared EU values. Hands have built Europe – its physical infrastructure, its artistic heritage, its literature, and its many other features. Hands build, weave, heal, teach, guide, and so much more. Hands tell tales of labour, age and relationships. They also share stories of heritage, history and culture. It is time to celebrate the hands that have built Europe and continue to do so every day.
Advantages
Gives a sense of unity and togetherness.
Easy to visualise.
A story focused on people rather than countries.
Timeless: hands as expressers of human emotion.
It is very strong on emotive connectivity, since hands are the tool of human touch.
Disadvantages
The symbols could be misinterpreted. (A good design is therefore crucial. Some research into anthropological aspects would also be helpful to avoid any embarrassing misunderstanding across cultures.)
Citizens connect much more easily with nature, animals and people, although this issue can be addressed through a good design. The theme does not exclude the possibility of incorporating these aspects and, of course, hands belong to people.
Some similarities with Swiss franc banknotes, although they tell different stories.
“Our Europe, ourselves”
Description
We each have our own story. We each create our own identity. But we also share a common identity as Europeans. We grow as individuals but also as part of a community, through our relationships with each other.
This theme indicates the freedom, the values and openness of people in Europe.
Story
The banknotes represent the individual and collective lives of the people who inhabit Europe through six different dimensions: being, doing, thinking, loving, communicating, and living. These are the ways in which we connect our inner selves to the outer world, the private to the public, self to society, the physical body to the symbolic realm.
Advantages
It focuses on the individual within the framework of Europe.
It opens the idea of European identity to everybody (within Europe and in the wider world).
It focuses on individuality and on the symbolic understanding of being and togetherness.
Disadvantages
Potential misunderstanding of the word “identity”.
Very abstract.
1 Introduction
As part of its plans to redesign euro banknotes, on 6 December 2021 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the launch of the process for selecting new themes and designs for future euro banknotes.
Once the design process has been completed, the Governing Council will authorise the production of new euro banknotes and decide on potential issuance dates. It can take several years for new banknotes to be developed, issued and put into circulation.
The theme and design process consists of two consecutive main steps.
Step 1: Theme selection – establish a list of eligible themes and select the one(s) that will be used in the design contest.
Step 2: Selection of designs – establish a list of possible motifs and organise a design contest.
This document focuses on the first step and, more specifically, on the work of the Theme Advisory Group (TAG), an independent and multidisciplinary group established in the second half of 2021 to advise on and propose a shortlist of new themes for future euro banknotes. The TAG has three objectives:
review and take into account the findings from the qualitative research on future themes for euro banknotes, which was conducted via focus groups between December 2021 and March 2022;
draw up a shortlist of potential themes and associated motifs, ranked in order of preference;
draft a brief story for each of the themes on the final shortlist.
Once the TAG has made its proposals, the ECB will consult the public on their preferred themes from the shortlist.
To support the first step of the theme and design process, the ECB commissioned the market research company Ipsos to carry out qualitative research to find out the European public’s views and preferences with regard to the theme of future euro banknotes
[

. The research was conducted via online focus groups in all 19 euro area countries plus Croatia and Bulgaria. The purpose of the research was twofold: (i) to understand the public’s preferences as to the theme of future euro banknotes, with a view to producing a list of preferred themes and associated motifs; and (ii) to understand public perceptions of the common design elements
[

]
of the current Europa series of banknotes as well as possible new common design elements, again with the aim of drawing up a list of preferred common design elements.
2 Establishing the Theme Advisory Group
The TAG was established in the second half of 2021 in order to consider possible new themes for the future euro banknotes. The group comprises an eclectic mix of independent high-level experts drawn from diverse fields such as the history, natural and social sciences, the visual arts and technology and representing all the countries in the euro area.
Once the Governing Council had approved the process for developing new themes and designs, the ECB asked each national central bank in the euro area to nominate a maximum of three candidates to represent their country in the TAG. The ECB assessed all nominees and a final list of 19 members – representing each euro area country – was submitted to the ECB’s Executive Board and to the Governing Council for approval. Malta and Estonia had to replace their respective nominees with new candidates early on in the process as the original candidates withdrew for personal reasons. At a later stage in the process the TAG members representing Portugal and Belgium stepped down owing to incompatible professional commitments. Because the TAG’s work was already at an advanced stage, it was not considered appropriate to launch a process to select new nominees.
The final composition of the TAG (including three ECB representatives, who do not have voting rights) was as follows:
Lisa Borgenheimer (Germany), Professor of Information Design, HfG Offenbach am Main
Toomas Kiho (Estonia), Editor-in-chief, Akadeemia
Fintan O’Toole (Ireland), Professor in Irish Letters, Princeton University, and columnist at The Irish Times

3 The work of the Theme Advisory Group
The TAG held nine meetings between 9 December 2021 and 7 July 2022, both virtually and in hybrid format. To facilitate the Group’s work, TAG members were given some background information on the world of banknotes, the redesign process and similar redesign projects carried out by other central banks.
The Group was tasked with drawing up a shortlist of themes and associated motifs for future euro banknotes and to draft a story for each of the shortlisted themes. Members took into account the findings from the qualitative research on future themes. Each member was asked to draft two proposals for a theme: one based on their own ideas and one based on the input received from the public via the qualitative study conducted by Ipsos.
At the start of the process the TAG agreed on the criteria to be used in selecting the themes. After exchanging views and familiarising themselves with the criteria used in selecting the theme for the first series of euro banknotes, the TAG members identified seven criteria and classified them as either essential, main or desirable.
The Group also decided on the ranking method that they would use to produce a shortlist of themes ranked in order of preference. The TAG agreed that they would use an anonymous two-round voting system to obtain the final shortlist.
4 Theme criteria
The TAG agreed on seven criteria – which were classified as essential, main or desirable – and assessed all of the proposed themes against them. All of the themes met the essential criteria.
Essential criteria
European: the theme should symbolise Europe, carry a message of European unity and integration and represent European citizens and European values. Chief among these values are democracy and the equal dignity of all people.
Inclusive: the theme should transcend any set of meanings specific to any one Member State or to any one historic, cultural or gender identity. It should speak to people of all ages and backgrounds.
Main criteria
Human/emotive: the theme should be inspiring, animate and able to connect with people’s feelings, experiences and lives in a positive way.
Acceptable: the theme should inspire the greatest possible degree of assent and enthusiasm from the general public.
Legible: illustrations of the theme should strike a balance between being legible and understandable by everybody and being able to demonstrate a certain level of depth and complexity.
Desirable criteria
Attractive: the theme should facilitate the portrayal of artistically accomplished and aesthetically pleasing design features with an appealing story and motifs.
Timeless: the theme should not be affected by the passing of time or reflect contemporary events that might not be topical in the future.
5 Voting and ranking process
The TAG agreed that a two-round online voting system would be used to arrive at a final shortlist.
The first round of voting was conducted anonymously online. TAG members were not allowed to vote for their own proposals. During this round, the TAG assessed the 29 proposed themes against the previously defined criteria (essential, main and desirable). If a theme was not considered to be European or inclusive, it was assigned a score of zero and eliminated from the selection process. Themes that met the essential criteria were awarded a score from 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest) for each of the main and desirable criteria. Therefore, the maximum possible score a theme could receive was 25, and the minimum was zero.
Members voted on the 29 themes, and the Group agreed to review the ten highest ranked themes, also with a view to merging similar proposals. This resulted in a shortlist of six themes, which were then put through to a second round of voting.
The second round of voting was conducted using the paired comparison method, whereby the themes were compared against each other and the difference in importance assigned a value from 0 to 3. This second round of voting resulted in the final shortlist of six ranked themes.
6 Theme proposals
It was decided that each TAG member would propose two themes – one based on their own ideas and one based on input from the public – and that they would assess their proposals against the previously defined criteria (essential, main and desirable). During the process some members decided to submit just one theme proposal. Each member presented their proposal(s) to the group in the meetings held on 21 April 2022 and 12 May 2022. These presentations were followed by extensive discussions.
The Group proposed 29 themes in total, which generally reflected the broader theme proposals suggested by the public in the qualitative research.
There was a broad consensus among TAG members that they should try to avoid suggesting motifs or narratives that draw too heavily upon on any one national culture
Members felt that themes should avoid the gender biases inherent in many representations of Europe’s past. There was a strong overall preference for imagery that could connect the banknotes to a dynamic Europe of people and nature over any undue emphasis on institutions or static symbols of the past. TAG members hoped to be able to propose themes that could convey a strong sense of shared European values while at the same time resonating powerfully with European citizens. Equally, TAG members, while highly conscious of the importance of contemporary events, acknowledged the need for the banknotes to be relevant and recognisable to those who will use them in decades to come. The theme should be forward-looking while reflecting contemporary perspectives and dimensions.
Many TAG members were of the view that EU or European values should be captured in the bank notes in some way. The discussions revealed different ideas, such as EU values, EU institutions, key figures in the history of the EU, and EU symbols. In the end, most proposals appeared to be grounded in, or draw inspiration from, the concept of EU values and how the theme could foster a better understanding of EU values today while also linking the ideals of Europe’s ancient past to its bright future.
The Group also considered how themes could reference the climate crisis and biodiversity loss – as one of the biggest challenges facing Europeans – or a future with diverse European communities and people crossing borders.
6.1 The TAG’s final theme proposals
Below is the final shortlist of themes proposed by the TAG, ranked in order of preference.
6.1.1 “European values mirrored in nature”
Description
The six banknotes feature the six values of the European Union as defined in the Treaty of Lisbon: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law and human rights. We also use visual imagery to convey a seventh value: our connection to, and respect for, our environment and the natural world.
Story
Europe is not only a living place, it is also an idea. And the EU is not just an organisation, but also a set of values.
We bring these values together with nature as aspects of the same underlying ethos. We reaffirm the role of European values as the building blocks of a Europe of the people, by the people, for the people. Sustainability and environmental preservation are then incorporated as a further fundamental value. These are European values, naturally.
Potential motifs
The six banknotes align nicely with the six core values of Europe. So each euro banknote represents one European value illustrated with different natural scenes on the front and other more human/planet-centric motifs on the back.
€5: Freedom
Front: animals – birds flying freely in the sky.
Back: humans – a human-based depiction of the value of freedom, such as a person or a group of people moving freely, dancing or running.
€10: Human dignity
Front: mountain landscape – a mountain range or a majestic mountain.
Back: humans – a baby’s hand holding or touching an older hand.
€20: Democracy
Front: coastal landscape – a seascape with a beach. Every grain of sand and every drop of water matter, just as every European citizen counts.
Back: humans/monuments – democracy through the lens of monuments, with a depiction of the hemicycle of the European Parliament building in Brussels, juxtaposed with a hand voting or a group of people raising their hands as a symbol of democracy.
€50: Equality
Front: forest landscape – forest scene with trees. The trees appear equal, yet they are different and contribute equally to the forest.
Back: humans/science and education – equality is depicted through the lens of science and education, with a particular emphasis on healthcare, for example a physician treating a patient while surrounded by students or the hand of healing and concern extended to all.
€100: Rule of law
Front: river landscape – a river on its inexorable path towards the sea, flowing within its banks, free but controlled and channelled.
Back: humans – an image of justice, either the traditional motif of blind justice with the scales or a more representative image of justice.
€200: Human rights
Front: flower landscape – diverse flowers, each different, each beautiful, each precious, represent diverse societies which together form a beautiful bouquet. Human rights are necessary for a society to blossom.
Back: humans and environment – motifs related to human and environmental diversity with an emphasis on the green transition and climate change. This banknote (the highest-value banknote in the series) will emphasise diversity between people and between our ecosystems as necessary pillars for a healthy and blooming society and planet.
Advantages
The two key ideas in this theme – European values and nature – were two of the most popular themes proposed in the focus groups.
European values are inclusive of all nations and people in Europe. The theme is timeless and transcends all borders.
Disadvantages
Given that values are somewhat abstract concepts, the success of this theme will greatly depend on the design chosen to represent the values. At the same time representing these abstract yet extremely important concepts on the banknotes is quite a beautiful thing.
6.1.2 “Birds: free, resilient and inspiring”
Description
This theme is inspired by the EU Birds Directive, which aims to protect all of the 500 wild bird species in the EU. The Directive is one of the oldest pieces of EU legislation on the environment and exemplifies the shared responsibility and cooperation of the EU’s 27 Member. It also reminds us of the need to share our continent with all the life forms that sustain our common existence. These birds are real and vivid in themselves and also a symbol of our collective identity.
Story
Birds have always lived near humans, and by closely observing their appearance and behaviour over the centuries, we have learned a lot about the environment and ourselves.
Birds do not care about national borders so they have always symbolised freedom and aspiration. Their nests remind us of our own desire to build places and societies where we can nurture the future. In their songs we hear our own appreciation of free and beautiful expression. When they return with their seasonal migration, we feel hope. They enrich the world without depleting it – as we should too.
Potential motifs
Each banknote takes its imagery from a particular European bird. Each bird represents a season of the year and a type of European landscape and human activity. The birds mentioned below are for illustrative purposes only.
€5: Skylark
Seen in many European cultures as the harbinger of spring. On the banknote it is accompanied by the landscapes it inhabits: the farms and fields of agricultural life, exemplifying the value of day-to-day work.
€10: Cuckoo
The sound of our summers, the voice of our forests, hills and lush, blooming landscapes. They personify happiness and joy.
€20: Tern
A bird of the water and seascapes. It is a migrant, covering vast distances but also returning to the same colony to hatch its eggs. It stands for community and family values.
€50: Owl
A bird of winter which has long been a symbol of wisdom. It stands for Europe’s living heritage of learning, science and reflection, and reminds us that our progress cannot come at the expense of the natural world.
€100: Stork
A bird of autumn and of villages, towns and cities. Their nests – on our chimneys and spires – remind us of how we can coexist with nature, giving it a place to be reborn and receive joy. This bird represents a link between folk wisdom and the modern world.
€200: Hoopoe and/or roller
These species are in rapid decline and will disappear from Europe if we do not act to protect them. The images on the banknotes should inspire preservation. They give us both a warning of what will happen if we do not move to a sustainable future and the hope that we can do so.
Advantages
This theme has a strong European dimension and a bold message for sustainability.
It makes an emotional connection and is legible, inclusive and timeless.
It lends itself to a visually pleasing and memorable design.
It reveals the diversity of Europe’s nature, landscapes and seasons.
Disadvantages
Some people do not like or are afraid of birds (ornithophobia).
Some other countries have birds on their banknotes.
6.1.3 “The future is yours”
Description
This theme creates “portraits” of Europeans of the future. The bearers of these banknotes are the bearers of the collective imagination in which people create their own, as yet undefined, possibilities.
This theme shows the boundless potential of Europeans and the dream to be portrayed on the banknote one day.
Story
The ideas and innovations that will shape the future of Europe lie deep within every European. Europe is shaped in your thoughts, your dreams, your skills and your inventions. The future is yours.
Potential motifs
Every banknote has a placeholder for a “future portrait”, such as whitespace, an outline or a reflective surface. On one side, the motifs are symbolically represented through historical and/or current tools, methods and objects. On the other side, we see the future visions of the “future person” (you, the bearer of the note). Everybody can see themselves on the banknote in their future job or area of expertise.
€5: Education and knowledge
Philosophy, writing and research.
€10: Art
Painting, cinema, theatre, music, dance and architecture.
€20: Science and technology
Space, energy and industry.
€50: Media and communication
Information technology, digitalisation and virtual reality.
€100: Nature
Environment and sustainability.
€200: Democracy
Citizenship, activism and deliberation.
Advantages
It highlights innovations, ideas and new perspectives for Europe.
It connects the past to the present and the future.
It is inclusive and emotive.
Disadvantages
It could be seen as a theme for younger people.
It is very abstract.
6.1.4 “Rivers: the waters of life in Europe”
Description
This theme combines the public’s strong desire for banknotes that celebrate the natural wonders of Europe with a broader message about interconnectedness and sustainability.
Story
Europe’s rivers cross borders. They connect us to each other and to nature. They remind us of the deep sources of our common life and also represent the flow and flux of a dynamic, ever-changing continent. They nurture us and we must nurture them in return.
Potential motifs
Drawing inspiration from real European landscapes, the longest rivers that cross several countries and come from the highest mountains, this theme follows the stages of a river, from source to sea, through rugged mountains and grand cities, from quiet wilderness to busy commerce. It also draws on the many forms of water itself, from the single cell to the mighty torrent, from solid ice to rushing rapids. It draws on the deep European history of imagining and depicting rivers as gods and, in particular, goddesses – a spirit that is bountiful and life-giving but that must be honoured and protected.
The proposal gives the designer a possibility to journey through Europe to create a story.
One example for motifs could be:
€5: the beginning of a river coming from the mountain
€10, €20, €50 and €100: the river passes through valleys, cultivated landscapes, and historical and contemporary landscapes to arrive at…
€200: … the sea.
Advantages
This proposal includes the values that we share and should protect, but the theme is not abstract.
Rivers cross borders freely.
Rivers connect and facilitate trade.
Preserving nature is one of the most important goals of Europe and the Europeans.
Timeless and natural beauty.
Disadvantages
No emotional connection.
Not a strict European theme.
6.1.5 “Hands: together we build Europe”
Description
This theme creates a physical and easily understood representation of the six core values of the EU: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law and human rights. It also takes inspiration from the motto of the European Union: “United in diversity”. The human hand – familiar to all of us but never the same in any two people – is sued to make these abstract ideas feel more immediate and human.
Story
“Hands: together we build Europe” uses a universal language to celebrate diversity and unity. It represents everyone who has shaped Europe through our shared EU values. Hands have built Europe – its physical infrastructure, its artistic heritage, its literature, and its many other features. Hands build, weave, heal, teach, guide, and so much more. Hands tell tales of labour, age and relationships. They also share stories of heritage, history and culture. It is time to celebrate the hands that have built Europe and continue to do so every day.
Potential motifs
The organisation of the motifs/images on each banknote is inspired by the universal values as defined in the Lisbon Treaty. The suggested motifs/images try to capture as broad a representation of each topic as possible.
€5: The hands that carve human dignity
Hands with broken shackles and the sun shining through, symbolising the right to a dignified life.
€10: The hands that forge our freedoms
A hand holding a book, along with a dove and sunlight, in motion and moving in a vertical or diagonal direction to give a sense of moving forward.
€20: The hands that build democracy
A variety of hands that are building a structure alongside a hand with a ballot paper in the process of voting.
€50: The hands that encourage equality
Hands holding up the rainbow flag, along with a sign language interpretation symbol that stands for disability. Here again the hands can show different genders and ages. A possible alternative could be the creative use of a representation of the hands from Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam, which would be used to represent equality.
€100: The hands that fight for human rights
Represented through a focus on work, health, and the environment. A hand administering a vaccine and a hand planting a tree. A healthy life and a healthy environment are fundamental human rights and are the basis for a more sustainable EU.
€200: The hands that ensure justice (rule of law)
Represented by creating the scales of justice (a classic representation of justice) from a variety of hands coming together and supporting each side.
Advantages
Gives a sense of unity and togetherness.
Easy to visualise.
A story focused on people rather than countries.
Timeless: hands as expressers of human emotion.
It is very strong on emotive connectivity, since hands are the tool of human touch.
Disadvantages
The symbols could be misinterpreted. (A good design is therefore crucial. Some research into anthropological aspects would also be helpful to avoid any embarrassing misunderstanding across cultures.)
Citizens connect much more easily with nature, animals and people, although this issue can be addressed through a good design. The theme does not exclude the possibility of incorporating these aspects and, of course, hands belong to people.
Some similarities with Swiss franc banknotes, although they tell different stories.
6.1.6 “Our Europe, ourselves”
Description
We each have our own story. We each create our own identity. But we also share a common identity as Europeans. We grow as individuals but also as part of a community, through our relationships with each other.
This theme indicates the freedom, the values and openness of people in Europe.
Story
The banknotes represent the individual and collective lives of the people who reside in Europe through six different dimensions: being, doing, thinking, loving, communicating, and living. These are the ways in which we connect our inner selves to the outer world, the private to the public, self to society, the physical body to the symbolic realm.
Potential motifs
Through these banknotes we all share the same identity. Each banknote has a pair of images, one drawn from the bodily and immediate representation of human individuality and the other from the symbolic order of common European values and aspirations:
Realistic/pictorial: standing for the living, self-created individual.
Symbolic: for the overall European concept, community and its values.
€5: Being
Faces and bodies.
€10: Loving
Heart, nurture, romantic, love and LGBTIQ+.
€20: Doing
Hands, action, interaction and gesture.
€50: Thinking
Brain, opinions and democratic deliberation, and learning.
€100: Living
Lungs, nature, animals, air and biodiversity.
€200: Communicating
Mouth, free speech, open expression and richness of languages.
Advantages
It focuses on the individual within the framework of Europe.
It opens the “European identity” to everybody (within Europe and in the wider world).
It focuses on individuality and on the symbolic understanding of being and togetherness.
Disadvantages
Misunderstanding of the word “identity”.
Very abstract.
6.2 The TAG’S original theme proposals:
There are no proposals from Portugal and Belgium, as their members stepped down from TAG. Given the advanced stage of the process, it was agreed not to seek replacements for these members. For other reasons, no proposals were submitted by the member from Slovakia.
7 TAG suggestions for the design guidelines
TAG members also suggested some ideas for the design guidelines in the next step of the redesign process.
All the banknotes could fit together in such a way that when the six banknotes are arranged next to each other, the individual designs connect to make one larger image, for example:
a handshake extending across the six banknotes;
the circle of stars across the six banknotes.
While there were different views on this idea, it was suggested that each side of the banknotes could have a different purpose. For instance, the front would be the more “creative” side featuring the theme, and the back would be the more “practical” side containing some of the common design elements.
The future banknotes could have a digital dimension, using different techniques, such as augmented reality, to allow the public to learn more about the banknotes. Augmented reality is already used in other banknotes[3]
.
Some of the security features, such as iridescence and holograms, could be used to show dimensionality and movement.
Common design elements to be included:
The issuer (ECB), and the acronym in all languages
The year of first issuance
Signature
Map of Europe, without political borders
Flag and/or circle of stars

Compared with April 2023:
consumer inflation expectations for the next 12 months decreased further, while those for inflation three years ahead remained stable;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased slightly, while expectations for nominal spending growth continued to decline;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers expect lower growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months decreased to 8.0% in May 2023, from 8.9% in April. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months also decreased to 3.9%, from 4.1% in April, while those for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged at 2.5%. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead fell to its lowest level since March 2022 (after the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine), although it remained above levels observed prior to this. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the three-year horizon. Inflation perceptions and expectations continued to be closely aligned across income classes, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) still reporting lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to increase by 1.2%, compared with 1.1% in April. The increase in expected nominal income growth was mainly concentrated in the two lowest quintiles of the income distribution, while consumers’ expectations in the fifth (highest) income quintile decreased, on average. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months decreased slightly to 6.8%, from 7.0% in April. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months decreased further to 3.5%, from 3.8% in April and 4.1% in March. The higher income groups reported a sharper drop in expectations for nominal spending growth than the lower two quintiles of the income distribution. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months were slightly less negative, standing at -0.7% compared with -0.8% in April. In line with these less negative expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 11.0%, from 11.2% in April. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be only slightly higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (10.9%), implying a broadly stable labour market. Consumers in the lowest income quintile reported the largest decline in perceived and expected unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.1% over the next 12 months – the lowest value reported in the past two years – compared with 2.2% in April. The decline in expectations was driven by respondents aged 55 to 70 and was broad-based across income categories, with the noticeable exception of the lowest income quintile. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead edged up to 5.1%, from 5.0% in April. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both eased slightly compared with April. (Housing and credit access results)

Credit terms and conditions tightened for all types of counterparty between March and May 2023
Resources and attention dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures to banks and dealers increased
With the exception of domestic government bonds, financing rates/spreads increased for funding secured against all types of collateral
Overall credit terms and conditions in the securities financing and OTC derivatives markets tightened for all types of counterparty between March and May 2023. This was a continuation of the developments observed over the previous eight quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the March 2023 survey. The tightening of credit terms and conditions was most pronounced for banks and dealers and insurance companies. Survey respondents mainly attributed this tightening to a deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning – and, to a lesser extent, concerns about an expected deterioration in the financial strength of counterparties and reduced competition from other institutions. Respondents expected overall credit terms to tighten further over the period from June to August 2023. Importantly, 40% of respondents reported that the amount of resources and attention dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures to banks and dealers had increased over the review period.

Changes in overall credit terms and price/non-price terms offered to counterparties across all transaction types
(Q2 2022 to Q2 2023; net percentages of survey respondents)
Source: ECB.
Note: Net percentages are calculated as the difference between the percentage of respondents reporting “tightened somewhat” or “tightened considerably” and the percentage reporting “eased somewhat” or “eased considerably”.
Turning to financing conditions for various types of collateral in securities financing transactions, survey respondents reported a mixed picture as regards the maximum amount of funding offered against euro-denominated collateral. While respondents also reported a mixed picture as regards the maximum maturity of funding for average clients, a significant percentage of respondents reported an increase in the maximum maturity of funding secured against domestic government bonds for most-favoured clients. With the exception of domestic government bonds, financing rates/spreads increased for funding secured against all types of collateral. The most pronounced increases in financing rates/spreads were observed for asset-backed securities, high-quality non-financial corporate bonds and high-yield corporate bonds. Respondents also reported an increase in overall demand for funding, which was even more pronounced for funding with a maturity of greater than 30 days.
Finally, turning to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, survey respondents reported that initial margin requirements had decreased for commodity derivatives, but few changes were reported for other types of derivative. Survey respondents reported a mixed picture as regards the maximum amount of exposure and the maximum maturity of trades. Liquidity and trading deteriorated somewhat for foreign exchange derivatives, credit derivatives referencing corporates and structured credit products, and total return swaps referencing non-securities. Finally, survey participants reported an overall decline in the volume, duration and persistence of valuation disputes.
The results of the June 2023 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The June 2023 survey collected qualitative information on changes between March and May 2023. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 27 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 13 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Proposed legislation establishes framework facilitating the possible introduction of a digital euro that is widely usable and available throughout the euro area
ECB also welcomes Commission proposal to protect legal tender status of euro cash
Governing Council to decide in autumn whether to move to next phase of digital euro project
The European Commission has published today its legislative proposal on a digital euro.
Like banknotes and coins are now, a digital euro would be a universal means of payment across the entire euro area. The proposed legal tender status for the digital euro would ensure it is widely accepted as a means of payment. The provision that people can get digital euros through their bank on request would make it easily accessible and ensures that nobody would be left behind.
The proposal also foresees that people could use basic digital euro services for free. At the same time, the proposal offers private intermediaries appropriate economic incentives to distribute the digital euro as they do other digital means of payment, while preventing excessive fees for merchants.
Moreover, the proposed legislation supports a high degree of privacy and data protection for users, while minimising money laundering and terrorist financing risks. It enables offline digital euro payments, to provide cash-like privacy levels.
“The euro is the most tangible symbol of European integration”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “It is highly valued and trusted by citizens. We look forward to continuing working together with other EU institutions towards a digital euro to ensure our currency is fit for the digital age.”
The investigation phase of the digital euro project will conclude in October 2023. The Governing Council of the ECB will then decide whether to move to the next phase of the project. In the next phase, the ECB would further develop and test the technical solutions and business arrangements. A possible decision by the Governing Council to issue a digital euro would be taken only after the legislative act is adopted.
“The legislative proposal is key to ensuring that the digital euro brings value to the people, taking the appreciated features of cash into the digital sphere”, said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “The ECB also welcomes the Commission’s proposal on the legal tender status of euro cash, to ensure banknotes remain easily accessible for citizens and businesses and widely accepted throughout the euro area.”
The ECB welcomes the Commission’s proposal aiming to ensure that cash continues to be a vital part of the payments system. It is crucial that cash remains widely accepted in physical transactions in line with its legal tender status. People and businesses need to be able to efficiently withdraw and deposit their money. The legislative proposal ensures that both acceptance of and access to euro banknotes and coins is legally guaranteed, so that everyone who wants to pay with cash can do so.
The ECB stands ready to provide technical input to support the work of the EU co-legislators. The European Commission has recommended that the European Parliament and the EU Council consult the ECB on the proposed legislative changes. Following requests for consultation, the ECB would deliver its opinion in due course.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published consolidated banking data as at end-2022, a dataset for the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
These annual data provide information required to analyse the EU banking sector and are broader in scope than the standard quarterly releases. The data cover 314 banking groups and 2,375 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), accounting for nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. They include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheet composition, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample.
Reporters generally apply the International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s Implementing Technical Standards on Supervisory Reporting. However, some small and medium-sized reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may include some data that are based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
As a consequence of the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision strengthened its framework, establishing, among other things, a minimum requirement for funding: the net stable funding ratio. This was implemented via the revised version of the Capital Requirements Regulation that was published in June 2019 and became applicable on 28 June 2021 with the aim of preventing excessive maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding.
In addition to data as at end-December 2022, the published figures also include a few revisions to past data.

Euro remains second most widely used currency, amid geopolitical risks and high inflation
Euro’s share at around 20% across various indicators of international currency use
Euro’s global appeal linked to stronger Economic and Monetary Union
The international role of the euro was resilient in 2022, with its share across various indicators of international currency use averaging close to 20%. This was one of the main findings in the annual review of the international role of the euro, published today by the European Central Bank (ECB).
Last year was marked by the onset of Russia’s war in Ukraine and heightened geopolitical risks, in a context of rising inflationary pressures. Against that backdrop, the euro remained the second most important currency globally.
“Despite a succession of new shocks, the international role of the euro remained resilient in 2022. This resilience was noteworthy”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “However, international currency status should not be taken for granted. This new landscape increases the onus on European policy makers to create the conditions for the euro to thrive”.
The share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased by 0.5 percentage points to 20.5% in 2022, when measured at constant exchange rates. The share of the euro increased across most other market segments, such as in foreign exchange settlements and in the outstanding stocks of international debt securities, loans and deposits. The international role of the euro in foreign currency-denominated bond issuance, including international green bonds, as well as in invoicing of extra-euro area imports and exports, remained stable.
Looking ahead, the international role of the euro will be primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union, including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete Economic and Monetary Union.
“Further European economic and financial integration will be pivotal in increasing the resilience of the international role of the euro in a potentially more fragmented world economy,” said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta.
This year’s interim edition of the report includes three special features. The first sheds light on the future of the international monetary system in the context of Russia’s war in Ukraine. It notes that evidence of potential fragmentation of the international monetary system in the wake of Russia’s invasion is not indicative of broader trends.
The second special feature reviews the evidence on the way in which one leading international currency can be replaced by another, drawing on new ECB staff research into invoicing currency patterns among countries neighbouring the euro area. The third feature looks at the role international currencies play in global finance, and provides insights into determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank lending.

,"Foreword
Despite a succession of new shocks, the international role of the euro remained resilient in 2022. This was a year that saw the onset of Russia’s war in Ukraine, a rise in economic sanctions and a substantial increase in geopolitical risks – all with potential repercussions for the international monetary system. However, the share of the euro across various indicators of international currency use continued to average close to 20%. The euro remained the second most important currency globally.
This resilience was noteworthy in a context of rising inflationary pressures worldwide – in part owing to war-related energy and food price increases – which led to tighter monetary policies across major economies and higher interest rates on the main international currencies.
But there are developments ahead to monitor for the euro as an international currency. This year’s report discusses the future of the international monetary system following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reviewing the available evidence. So far, the data do not show substantial changes in the use of international currencies. However, they do suggest that international currency status should not be taken for granted.
This new landscape increases the onus on European policymakers to create the conditions for the euro to thrive. Its international role is primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete EMU. Further European economic and financial integration will be pivotal in increasing the resilience of the international role of the euro in a potentially more fragmented world economy.
The ECB will continue to monitor developments and publish information on the international role of the euro on a regular basis.

1 Main findings
This 22nd annual review of the international role of the euro presents an overview of developments in the use of the euro by non-euro area residents. The report covers developments in 2022. This was a year that saw the onset of Russia’s war in Ukraine and a substantial increase in geopolitical risks with potential repercussions for the international monetary system. Rising inflationary pressures globally – in part coming from war-related energy and food price increases – and tighter monetary policies in major economies led to higher interest rates on the main international currencies.
Against this challenging background, a composite index of the international role of the euro remained resilient over the review period (Chart 1). Adjusting for exchange rate valuation effects, the index increased by around 1.3 percentage points. At current exchange rates, it remained largely unchanged. The share of the euro across various indicators of international currency use averaged close to 20%. The euro remained the second most important currency in the international monetary system (Chart 2).

Notes: The latest data for foreign exchange reserves, international debt and international loans are for the fourth quarter of 2022. SWIFT data are for December 2022. Foreign exchange turnover data are as at April 2022. *Since transactions in foreign exchange markets always involve two currencies, shares add up to 200%.
The share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased in 2022 by 0.5 percentage points to 20.5%, when measured at constant exchange rates (Table 1). The share of the US dollar declined by more than 2 percentage points, while the share of the renminbi was substantially unchanged. Box 1 examines whether the renminbi could play a stronger role as an international reserve currency despite China’s lack of full financial account openness. A strong dollar and large changes in the price of bonds issued by major economies encouraged official reserve managers to manage their portfolios actively in 2022. Net official purchases of assets denominated in currencies other than the US dollar increased, offsetting valuation effects arising from the dollar’s appreciation – which mechanically raised the share of the US dollar in official reserve portfolios at current exchange rates. Whether inflation developments influenced the decisions of official foreign exchange reserve investors is unclear, as shown by the poor correlation between changes in the share of major currencies in global foreign exchange reserves and inflation rates in the issuing economies. Box 3 discusses how these developments are not exceptional and reflect conventional reserve management strategies by central banks. Interest rates are another factor which can influence the management of reserve portfolios. While interest rates in the euro area returned to positive territory, they remained lower than in other major economies, which could have discouraged rebalancing to euro-denominated assets. Box 2 shows that interest rate differentials are important determinants in the active rebalancing of the government debt portfolios of a sample of US mutual fund managers, much as they influence investment decisions of official reserve managers.
[

Finally, heightened geopolitical risks might have played a role in the investment decisions of official reserve managers in some countries. Special Feature A shows that the accumulation of gold as an official reserve asset was especially strong in countries that are geopolitically close to China and Russia. This may be because such countries are looking to reduce their exposure to the risk of financial sanctions. Higher inflation globally might confound these developments, however, insofar as gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflationary risks.
Other indicators of the international role of the euro tracked in this report also point to a noteworthy resilience in the attractiveness of the euro (Table 1). The share of the euro in the outstanding stock of international debt securities increased by more than 1 percentage point to 22.0% in 2022 compared with the previous year, when measured at constant exchange rates. The shares of the euro in the outstanding stocks of international loans and international deposits rose by around 2.4 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, in 2022. The share of the euro in foreign exchange settlements also increased by almost 3 percentage points to around 38%, when measured at constant exchange rates, over the review period. However, the latest BIS Triennial Survey points to a decline in the share of the euro in global foreign exchange turnover of around 1.8 percentage points since 2019, to 30.5%, owing to the relatively stronger growth of trading in other currencies, such as the US dollar and the renminbi. Box 4 shows that the City of London remained the main venue for foreign exchange trading in euro and that the United Kingdom’s importance for international financial activities in euro did not change materially after Brexit, albeit with a few exceptions. The international role of the euro in foreign currency bond issuance, including the issuance of international green bonds, was substantially stable. Finally, the share of the euro in the invoicing of extra-euro area imports and exports did not change significantly. The impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine on the international role of the euro was particularly visible in the form of a temporary surge in net shipments of euro cash outside the euro area, presumably for precautionary reasons (Box 5). This reversed in the second half of 2022 on the back of higher interest rates and opportunity costs of holding cash (Section 2.5).
As stressed in last year’s edition of this report, the European Union’s economic and financial resilience to the current geopolitical challenges underlines the strength of the international role of the euro. The international role of the euro is primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete EMU.
This year’s report includes three special features. The first special feature sheds light on the debate surrounding the future of the international monetary system following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reviewing the available evidence. Shortly after the invasion, several packages of sanctions were imposed on Russia, including the freezing of nearly half of the Russian central bank’s foreign exchange reserves and the exclusion of several Russian banks from SWIFT, the dominant financial messaging system for cross-border payments. Some observers noted that these sanctions may encourage countries that are not fully aligned with the United States geopolitically to cut their exposures to the currencies of sanctioning countries, while others were more sceptical and pointed to challenges in moving away from the major international currencies. The special feature shows that evidence of a potential fragmentation of the international monetary system since Russia’s invasion is so far mainly restricted to announcements and specific cases and is not indicative of broader trends. Anecdotal evidence, including official statements, points to the intention of some countries to develop the use of alternatives to the sanctioned currencies, such as the renminbi, the rouble and the Indian rupee, for the invoicing of international trade – notably in commodities. There is also evidence that Russia has been using the Chinese renminbi to a significantly greater extent for international invoicing and cross-border payments in the past few months. However, on the whole, the available data do not show substantial changes in the use of international currencies. One noteworthy development is evidence of diversification into gold by countries that are geopolitically close to China and Russia, perhaps in an attempt to reduce their risk of exposure to sanctions.
The second special feature aims to give a broader perspective to ongoing discussions on the future of the international monetary system and reviews the evidence – both old and new – on how one leading international currency is replaced by another. The conventional historical narrative is that inertia in international currency use is substantial – it takes a long time for a challenger currency to replace the incumbent unit as the presence of network externalities gives rise to lock-in effects. However, one interesting exception is the invoicing of trade by countries neighbouring the euro area, where the euro overtook the US dollar in the space of a few years, i.e. between 1999 – the year of the euro’s creation – and 2019. Two competing hypotheses may explain these developments: a trade shock – in which stronger trade links with the euro area tilted invoicing towards the euro – and an exchange rate volatility shock – in which growing use of the euro as an exchange rate anchor spilled over to invoicing. New evidence from ECB staff research gives support to the first hypothesis, finding that a trade shock is a key determinant of the stronger role of the euro for invoicing international trade in countries neighbouring the euro area. In countries where trade links with the euro area increased, the shock accounts for almost 40% (on average) of the rise in the share of exports invoiced in euro between 1999 and 2019. By contrast, the impact of greater exchange rate stability against the euro is found to be statistically insignificant. Moreover, the estimates point to significant cross-country effects – the fact that countries’ invoicing currency choices are not just impacted by their own trade patterns and exchange rate volatilities, but also by those of their trade partners and competitors. These findings have implications for policy. They suggest that in response to the pandemic shock and the war in Ukraine, the reshoring or “friendshoring” of production chains could lead to stronger regional trade, notably on the European continent and, in turn, to a stronger role of the euro for invoicing international trade, with the caveat that such a reversal in global economic integration would bring other economic costs.
The third special feature looks at the role of international currencies in global finance. It provides insights into determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank lending, including bilateral distance, measures of linkages to the issuer countries through finance, trade and the use of vehicle currencies for trade invoicing. The special feature pinpoints several new facts. It highlights the centrality of the City of London for euro-denominated loans, albeit with tentative signs of adverse Brexit effects. It shows that offshore financial centres play a pivotal role in the international network of cross-border loans denominated in US dollars, which largely reflects lending to non-bank financial intermediaries (such as investment banks, finance companies, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies) in the Cayman Islands. Moreover, empirical estimates suggest that euro-denominated loans are driven by gravity effects, pointing to a stronger role of the euro in the immediate vicinity of the euro area, in contrast to US dollar loans which have a more global outreach. Finally, there is evidence that complementarity effects between trade invoicing and bank lending decisions – which are predicted to be significant according to recent theoretical models of international currency use – are stronger for the euro than for the US dollar.

Why doesn’t the currency of the second largest economy in the world play a more consequential reserve currency role? The share of the Chinese renminbi in global reserve portfolios, at about 3%, pales in comparison with those of the US dollar (about 60%) and the euro (about 20%).

2 Key developments
2.1 Use of the euro as an international reserve and investment currency
The share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased in 2022 when measured at constant exchange rates. At the end of 2022, official investors held about €11.4 trillion (USD 12.0 trillion) in foreign exchange reserves. Total foreign exchange reserves declined by more than 7 percentage points, when measured at current exchange rates, compared with the previous year (Table 1). The share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased by 0.5 percentage points to 20.5% in 2022 when measured at constant exchange rates (Chart 3). By contrast, the share of the euro remained broadly stable, declining by about 0.1 percentage points, when measured at current exchange rates (Chart 5). Overall, in the past seven years the share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves has remained within a relatively narrow range.

Interest rates and fixed-income yields on highly-rated euro area government bonds turned positive in 2022, although they remained lower than in other major economies. Interest rate differentials with other major advanced economies widened over the course of 2022, except with Japan. For instance, euro area long-term interest rates remained lower by around 200 basis points compared with the United States and about 150 basis points compared with the United Kingdom, which could have discouraged rebalancing to euro-denominated assets (Chart 4). Box 2 shows how interest rate differentials are important determinants of active rebalancing for US mutual fund managers across currencies within their portfolios of government debt securities,

which is consistent with evidence from the literature for official reserve managers.

A strong dollar and rising policy interest rates encouraged official reserve managers to manage their portfolios actively in 2022, to a large extent offsetting the valuation effects arising from exchange rate and bond price movements. In 2022 the share of the US dollar – the major global reserve currency – remained stable at around 58.4%, when measured at current exchange rates, although it declined by about 2.2 percentage points at constant exchange rates. Reserve managers sold an estimated USD 293 billion of US dollar assets in the review period. Net purchases of currencies other than the US dollar largely offset the impact of valuation effects stemming from the US dollar’s appreciation – which mechanically raises the share of the US dollar in official reserve portfolios. Net purchases of euro-denominated reserves by official investors reached an estimated €50 billion (USD 53 billion) in the review period.
[

]
Not only did the share of the euro increase at constant exchange rates but also the share of currencies other than the euro and the US dollar – by about 1.7 percentage points in the review period (Chart 3). In particular, the share of official reserve assets denominated in Japanese yen and pound sterling both increased by 0.5 percentage points, while the share of other major reserve currencies remained broadly stable (Chart 5). These developments are not exceptional and reflect conventional reserve management strategies by central banks. During periods of strong dollar appreciation reserve managers tend to stabilise the composition of their portfolios by selling dollar assets and purchasing assets in other major currencies, such as the euro (Box 3). In addition, foreign exchange interventions aiming at stabilising the exchange rate of the domestic currency against the US dollar or limiting its volatility become more likely when the US dollar appreciates, particularly in emerging markets, explaining net sales of US dollar-denominated reserve assets. According to a regular survey conducted by the investment bank UBS, rising interest rates in the US and inflation represented one of the main concerns for the investment of foreign exchange reserves.
[

]
The extent to which current inflation developments influenced the decisions of official foreign exchange reserve investors is not entirely clear as shown by the limited correlation between changes in the share of major currencies in global foreign exchange reserves and inflation rates in the issuing economies in 2022 (Chart 6).

To what extent do investors reallocate their portfolios of safe assets across major currencies in search for higher returns? In previous years, survey evidence suggested that relatively low yields in euro area fixed-income markets might have been a factor in moderating the global appeal of the euro as a reserve and investment currency.

Box 3
Valuation effects and rebalancing of official foreign exchange reserves
Prepared by Tamar den Besten, Massimo Ferrari Minesso and Maurizio Michael Habib
Movements in the exchange rates of major reserve currencies as well as in the market prices of securities held by central banks may have a significant impact on the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves, when measured at current exchange rates. For instance, a broad US dollar appreciation, as was the case in 2022, mechanically increases the share of the US dollar, as other currencies lose value against that currency. Similarly, if yields increase, the market value of bonds falls, leading to a stronger decline in the value of reserve assets denominated in currencies experiencing the largest decreases in bond prices. These developments, as noted by Chinn et al. (2022)
[

, confound active reserve management strategies through changes in the value of the underlying assets. This box reviews the evidence of the importance of these valuation effects for the adjustment of currency portfolios by reserve managers against the background of large fluctuations in exchange rates and bond prices seen in the past year.

2.2 The euro in global foreign exchange markets
The euro remained the second most actively traded currency in global foreign exchange markets after the US dollar. The share of the euro in global foreign exchange settlements increased slightly in 2022, according to data from the CLS system, standing at almost 38% in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 7, panel a) – an increase of almost 3 percentage points from the previous year when measured at constant exchange rates.
[

]
By contrast, the share of the US dollar decreased by more than 6 percentage points, although the US dollar remained the leading currency in global foreign exchange settlements – being involved in almost 90% of all settlements in the fourth quarter of 2022.
[
11
]
Volumes of euro settlements increased by over 20% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with the previous year, consistent with trends in the past few years (Chart 7, panel b).
The latest evidence from the Triennial Central Bank Survey of foreign exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, conducted by the BIS in April 2022, showed that the share of the euro decreased by 1.8 percentage points compared with the previous survey conducted in 2019 (Chart 8, panel a).
[
12
]
Global foreign exchange turnover increased by 14% compared with 2019, reaching USD 7.5 trillion. Overall, the US dollar remained the most used currency, being on one side of almost 90% of total OTC transactions, a share that is broadly stable compared with earlier surveys. Meanwhile, the euro was used in 31% of all trades, thereby remaining the second most actively traded currency.
[
13
]
Volumes of OTC trade in euro increased by USD 167 billion (or about 8%) relative to 2019, compared with even stronger increases for the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi of USD 830 billion (or about 14%) and USD 241 billion (or about 85%) respectively. The Chinese renminbi thus exhibited the largest increase in market share since the 2019 survey, being on one side of 7% of all trades in 2022 (up from 4% in 2019) to become the fifth most traded currency. The Japanese yen and pound sterling were on one side of 17% and 13% of all trades respectively, largely unchanged compared with the previous survey. Global foreign exchange trading activity involving the euro is concentrated in the United Kingdom, which accounts for more than 42% of total trading, as well as in the United States, the euro area, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore and Switzerland (Chart 8, panel b). Relative to the 2019 survey, euro foreign exchange (FX) trading activity in the United Kingdom contracted by 6 percentage points, standing close to the level prevailing at the time of the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Adjusted for local and cross-border inter-dealer double-counting (i.e. on a “net-net” basis). The data on geographical locations include spot transactions, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps, options and other products. They are adjusted for local inter-dealer double-counting (i.e. on a net-gross basis) and may differ slightly from national survey data owing to differences in aggregation procedures and rounding. The BIS uses several criteria to determine the location of a foreign exchange transaction, notably the location of the initiating sales desk.

When measured at constant exchange rates, the share of the euro in the stock of international debt securities stood at 22%, increasing by 1.2 percentage points in the review period. The share of the euro remains about 8 percentage points lower than its peak in the mid-2000s. By contrast, the share of the US dollar declined by about 1.2 percentage points, although it remains the leading currency in the international debt security markets, accounting for more than 65% of the global stock (Chart 9 and Table A4).

Granular data on international issuance of foreign currency-denominated bonds suggest that the volume of international bond issuance decreased markedly in 2022.
[
15
]
In 2022 the total volume of foreign currency-denominated bond issuance contracted by more than USD 700 billion, corresponding to a decline of 30% in relative terms over the review period. This decline occurred amid market concerns about the economic outlook, tighter financial conditions in advanced economies and geopolitical fragmentation risks (Special Feature A). In particular, the issuance of euro-denominated bonds decreased by about 30% in 2022 compared with the previous year, standing at €377 billion (USD 397 billion). However, the share of the euro in foreign currency-denominated bond issuance remained stable, at around 25% (Chart 10, panel a). Issuance of US dollar-denominated bonds (USD 930 billion in 2022) fell more markedly, by around 36% year on year, reducing the share of the dollar in international bond issuance by 5 percentage points.
[
16
]
Despite these developments, the US dollar remains by far the leading currency for international issuance of foreign currency-denominated bonds, accounting for more than 57% of total issuance in the review period (Chart 10, panel b). Notably, the share of currencies other than the US dollar and the euro increased to around 17%.

Note: The latest observation is for end-2022.
The retrenchment in euro-denominated international bond issuance was mainly driven by lower issuance in the United Kingdom, the United States and emerging markets. Issuance of euro-denominated international bonds contracted by 72% among emerging market economies in 2022 and by more than 40% in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan (Chart 11, panel b). At the same time, in non-euro area EU Member States and other advanced economies, issuance of euro-denominated bonds increased by 6 and 8 percentage points respectively. Issuance of US dollar-denominated bonds in emerging market economies declined by 55% (Chart 11, panel a).
[
17
]
The retrenchment might have arisen from higher interest rates and financing costs in advanced economies, combined with heightened volatility in bond markets. This might have in turn dampened demand for foreign currency-denominated debt issued by emerging market economies. The impact of Brexit on the role of the City of London as a centre for the intermediation of foreign currency-denominated funding might also explain the lower issuance of euro and US dollar-denominated debt in the United Kingdom (Box 4).

International issuance of green bonds also decreased substantially in the review period.
[

]
In absolute terms, the amount of international green bonds issued in major currencies contracted by about USD 41 billion (Chart 12, panel a). Issuance of green bonds denominated in euro decreased by €11 billion (USD 12 billion) for a total issuance of about €34 billion (USD 36 billion) in 2022. US dollar-denominated issuance also fell from USD 80 billion to USD 59 billion. In relative terms, the shares of euro and US dollar-denominated green bonds remained stable, with the two currencies accounting for about 31% and 51% of total issuance respectively.

2.3.2 The euro in international loan and deposit markets
The share of the euro in the outstanding stock of international loans continued to increase in 2022. Euro-denominated international loans increased by about 2.4 percentage points in the review period, when measured at constant exchange rates (Chart 13 and Table A6).
[
19
]
The share of the euro in 2022, at around 19%, is close to its historical peak of about 20% seen in 2005. By contrast, the share of the US dollar in international loan markets continued to decline, although the US dollar remains the leading currency in international loan markets by a large margin, accounting for about 53% of total loans. Geographical distance or complementarities with trade invoicing patterns tend to affect demand for euro-denominated and, to a lesser extent, dollar-denominated international loans (Special Feature C).

The share of outstanding international deposits denominated in euro continued to increase in 2022. The share of the euro rose by about 1.5 percentage points over the review period, when measured at constant exchange rates, standing at almost 18% (Chart 14 and Table A7).
[

]
By contrast, the share of US dollar-denominated deposits declined by about 1.4 percentage points in 2022 as investors reduced holdings of dollar-denominated deposits accumulated as liquid balances during the pandemic.
[

]
However, despite a marginal decline in 2022, the share of US dollar-denominated international deposits remained close to pre-pandemic levels, at around 52% of total international deposits.

Impact of Brexit on the international role of the euro
Prepared by Matthias Rau-Goehring
This box presents an early assessment of the changing role of the City of London for euro-denominated financial activities since Brexit.
[
22
]
Since its introduction in 1999, the City of London has been the leading financial centre for the international use of the euro in several market segments.
[
23
]
The decision of the United Kingdom in June 2016 to leave the EU was therefore seen as the portent of a potential change in the central role of the City of London for global financial markets.
[
24
]
This event was particularly relevant for euro financial activities that benefit from a harmonisation of rules and standards with the EU, such as trading in foreign exchange and OTC derivatives and banking services.
[
25
]
Data on these activities thus far, however, show no major shifts in the importance of the City of London for euro-denominated financial market segments, with some exceptions.

2.4 Use of the euro as an invoicing currency
The share of the euro as an invoicing or settlement currency for extra-euro area trade, in particular services exports, remained broadly stable in 2022. Extra-euro area exports of goods invoiced in euro declined by half a percentage point in 2022 to around 59%, while the share of extra-euro area imports of goods invoiced in euro also dropped by half a percentage point to below 52% (Chart 15, panel a and Table A8). However, such changes remain marginal and, from a long-term perspective, the role of the euro as an invoicing currency for trade in goods remains by and large unchanged. Almost 58% of extra-euro area services exports were invoiced in euro in 2022, down from around 60% in the previous year. The share of exports of services invoiced in euro, similar to the euro-invoiced share of exports of goods, also reached a historical low, continuing the downward trend seen since 2018. Likewise, just below 53% of extra-euro area imports of services were invoiced in euro in 2022, down by about 0.3 percentage points compared with the previous year (Chart 15, panel b).

2.5 Use of euro banknotes outside the euro area
Cumulative shipments of euro banknotes to destinations outside the euro area decreased to a ten-year low in 2022. The value of net registered shipments of euro banknotes to destinations outside the euro area declined by about 11% over the review period, the largest year-on-year decline since the launch of the euro (see Chart 16).

Notes: Net shipments are euro banknotes sent to destinations outside the euro area minus euro banknotes received from outside the euro area. The latest observation is for December 2022.
However, developments in shipments of euro banknotes outside the euro area differed markedly between the first half and second half of 2022. In the first half of the year, the value of net registered shipments of euro banknotes to destinations outside the euro area increased by around 8%. This surge in demand for euro cash was likely caused by the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine which spurred precautionary demand for euro banknotes in a number of central and eastern European countries outside the euro area neighbouring Ukraine (Box 5 on the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine on foreign demand for euro cash).
In the second half of 2022, net shipments of euro banknotes to destinations outside the euro area decreased markedly as a result of two factors. First, the beginning of monetary policy normalisation by the ECB led to an associated rise in opportunity costs of holding cash and may have encouraged decreases in cash holdings. In anticipation of the increase in ECB policy rates in July 2022, net shipments decreased by around 4% month-on-month – an unprecedented deceleration – followed by significant banknote purchases in the subsequent months. Second, geopolitical developments likely reduced sales of euro banknotes to eastern European countries outside the EU significantly. These countries accounted for 15% of total sales in 2022, compared with almost 30% in 2021 (Chart 17, panel a).

The impact of war: extreme demand for euro cash in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
Prepared by Elisabeth Beckmann and Alejandro Zamora-Pérez
Proximity to war boosts foreign and domestic demand for euro cash
Geopolitical conflicts can have a significant impact on the demand for euro cash outside the euro area, as illustrated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Chart A, panel a, compares the deviation of demand for euro banknotes from historical averages, both from non-euro area countries (blue line) and from countries within the euro area (dotted grey lines) between January 2021 and May 2022 – immediately after demand returned to near-average levels. In the months before the invasion, foreign demand for euro cash remained below its historical average. However, it rose far above its historical average just after the invasion (in March 2022), to an extent greater than in most euro area countries in that period. This suggests that precautionary motives were a determinant of demand for euro cash from non-euro area countries, mainly driven by high-value denominations (€100 and €200) which are mostly used for store-of-value purposes.

3 Special features
A Geopolitical fragmentation risks and international currencies
By Tamar den Besten, Paola Di Casola, Maurizio Michael Habib
Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, several packages of unprecedented sanctions were imposed on Russia, including the freezing of nearly half of the Russian central bank’s foreign exchange reserves and the exclusion of a number of Russian banks from SWIFT, the dominant financial messaging system used to facilitate cross-border payments. Several observers noted that these sanctions may have far-reaching consequences for the role of the currencies of the sanctioning countries – including the US dollar and the euro – in the international monetary and financial system. According to these observers, countries that are not fully aligned geopolitically with the United States might reduce their exposures to the currencies of sanctioning countries going forward. However, other observers have been more cautious and pointed to challenges involved in diversifying from the major international currencies. This special feature sheds light on this debate by reviewing the available evidence on the effects of geopolitical fragmentation risks on the use of international currencies. It shows that evidence of potential fragmentation in the international monetary system since Russia’s invasion has so far been mainly restricted to announcements and specific cases rather than pointing to broader trends. Anecdotal evidence, including official statements, points to intentions of some countries to develop the use of alternatives to major traditional currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi, the Russian rouble or the Indian rupee for invoicing international trade. There is also evidence that Russia has been using the Chinese renminbi to a significantly greater extent for international invoicing and cross-border payments in the past few months. However, the available data do not show substantial changes in the use of international currencies as yet. One exception is evidence of increased accumulation of gold as an alternative reserve asset, possibly driven by countries geopolitically closer to China and Russia.

B How is a leading international currency replaced by another? Old versus new evidence
By A. Mehl, M. Mlikota (University of Pennsylvania) and I. Van Robays
This special feature reviews the evidence – both old and new – on how a leading international currency is replaced by another. The conventional historical narrative is that inertia in international currency use is substantial – it takes a long time for a challenger currency to replace the incumbent owing to the existence of network externalities that give rise to lock-in effects. The US dollar remains the leading currency for global trade and finance today, despite the decline in the United States’ share of global output and trade, which testifies to the importance of inertia. However, one interesting exception is the currency invoicing of trade of countries neighbouring the euro area between 1999 – the year of the euro’s creation – and 2019, when the share of the euro increased by more than 20 percentage points on average, at the expense of the US dollar.
Two competing hypotheses may explain these developments: a trade shock – where stronger trade links with the euro area tilt invoicing towards the euro – and an exchange rate volatility shock – where growing use of the euro as an exchange rate anchor spills over to invoicing. Recent evidence from ECB staff research empirically tests the relative importance of these two shocks. The estimates give support to the view that a trade shock is a key determinant of the stronger role of the euro for invoicing international trade in countries neighbouring the euro area. In those countries where trade links with the euro area increased, the shock explains on average almost 40% of the rise in the share of exports invoiced in euro between 1999 and 2019. By contrast, the impact of greater exchange rate stability against the euro is statistically insignificant. Countries’ invoicing currency choices are not just impacted by their own trade patterns and exchange rate volatilities but also by those of their trade partners and competitors. These effects operate mainly via bilateral trade linkages rather than strategic complementarities in export price setting, which underscores the relevance of changes to input-output linkages as determinants of invoicing currency patterns.
These findings have implications for policy. They suggest that, in response to the pandemic shock and the war in Ukraine, reshoring or friendshoring of production chains could lead to stronger regional trade, notably on the European continent. That in turn could strengthen the future role of the euro for the invoicing of international trade.

C Determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank loans
By Lorenz Emter, Peter McQuade, Swapan Kumar Pradhan (BIS)
[

]
and Martin Schmitz
Dominant currencies confer important economic, financial and strategic advantages on the issuer, so it is important to understand why some currencies have a more prominent international role than others. This special feature provides insights into various potential determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank lending, such as bilateral distance, measures of financial and trade linkages to issuer countries of major currencies, and invoicing currency patterns. Cross-border bank lending in US dollars, and particularly in euro, is highly concentrated in a small number of countries. The United Kingdom is central in the international network of loans denominated in euro, although there are tentative signs that this role has diminished for lending to non-banks since Brexit, with such loans now possibly booked by newly-established US (or euro area) subsidiaries. Offshore financial centres are pivotal for US dollar loans, reflecting, in particular, lending to non-bank financial intermediaries in the Cayman Islands, possibly as a result of regulatory and tax optimisation strategies of large multinationals and high net worth individuals. An empirical analysis suggests that euro-denominated loans face the “tyranny of distance”, in line with predictions of standard models of trade, as captured by a variety of variables, in contrast to US dollar loans. Complementarities between trade invoicing and bank lending are found for both the euro and the US dollar. Overall, the analysis suggests that the euro tends to be more of a regional currency, while use of the US dollar in cross-border bank lending is global.

Inflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long. The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.
The rate increase today reflects the Governing Council’s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. According to the June macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Indicators of underlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening. Staff have revised up their projections for inflation excluding energy and food, especially for this year and next year, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. They now see it reaching 5.1% in 2023, before it declines to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. Staff have slightly lowered their economic growth projections for this year and next year. They now expect the economy to grow by 0.9% in 2023, 1.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.
At the same time, the Governing Council’s past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions and are gradually having an impact across the economy. Borrowing costs have increased steeply and growth in loans is slowing. Tighter financing conditions are a key reason why inflation is projected to decline further towards target, as they are expected to increasingly dampen demand.
The Governing Council’s future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council confirms that it will discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchase programme as of July 2023.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 4.00%, 4.25% and 3.50% respectively, with effect from 21 June 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem does not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023. The Governing Council will discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."
,"Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 14-15 June 2023
13 July 2023
1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel noted that, since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 3-4 May 2023, the narrative in financial markets had shifted from global tail risks – emanating from the banking sector tensions and the US debt ceiling debate – towards concerns about a deterioration in the euro area macroeconomic outlook and more persistent core inflation pressures globally.
Global market conditions had further normalised as tail risks to the economy had subsided. Volatility in financial markets had decreased notably across market segments and countries, suggesting that risks of systemic stress were currently contained. Stock market implied volatility in the United States, as measured by the VIX volatility index, had declined to its lowest level since the beginning of 2020.
Market conditions had also normalised across market segments in the euro area. Banks had restarted primary market issuance activity not only for covered bonds and senior bonds, but more recently also for subordinated bonds. Moreover, banks’ asset swap spreads of subordinated and senior bonds had decreased substantially, but remained slightly above the levels seen before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Spreads of non-financial corporate bonds had remained broadly stable and stood below the average levels recorded in 2022.
Developments in sovereign bond markets had been even more benign. Sovereign spreads relative to overnight index swap (OIS) rates had decreased during the market turmoil in March and had continued to narrow since then. Both the start of partial reinvestments and the expected end of reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP) had been absorbed smoothly by the market. Nevertheless, sovereign spreads had remained sensitive to fundamentals, as illustrated by the response to recent shifts in rating outlooks.
Negative macroeconomic data surprises had sparked investor concerns about a deterioration in the economic outlook. However, developments in equity markets argued against the hypothesis that markets were pricing in a severe economic downturn. Equity indices for euro area banks and non-financial corporations had seen only small changes. Moreover, defensive equity sectors, i.e. stocks which tend to be more stable during periods of expected economic weakness, had underperformed sectors more sensitive to the business cycle.
Developments in long-term risk-free bond yields had also provided little indication that negative data surprises had left a significant mark on the economic growth outlook. A decomposition of long-term yields into real rates and the inflation component in the euro area showed that real rates were slightly up since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 3-4 May 2023, and only marginally down since the collapse of SVB.
In the United States, real interest rates had continued to recover strongly from the banking sector turmoil. Markets were no longer pricing in the banking sector stress driving a significant wedge between the growth outlook in the euro area and the United States. This was also evident in the gap between ten-year real rates, which had widened again and was now as large as in early March. The divergence in risk-free rates in the euro area vis-à-vis the United States had also been reflected in the EUR/USD exchange rate. The euro had depreciated by around 3% since the previous monetary policy meeting, closely tracking movements in interest rate differentials.
Regarding the evolution of interest rate expectations, the front end of the euro short-term rate (€STR) forward curve had remained broadly unchanged. The forward curve was pricing in two more 25 basis point rate hikes – one at the present meeting and another in July – and a 20% probability of an additional 25 basis point hike afterwards, implying a peak deposit facility rate slightly above the level that had been expected at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. The inversion of the forward curve had moderated. By contrast, the US federal funds futures curve had shifted upwards markedly since the previous monetary policy meeting.
Uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy in the euro area had declined substantially since the collapse of SVB. Volatility in expected euro area short-term interest rates had reached its lowest level since May 2022, before the start of the ECB’s rate hiking cycle, reflecting the increasing convergence of monetary policy expectations among market participants.
The reduction in uncertainty about the ECB’s medium-term policy rate path seemed somewhat at odds with market participants’ inflation expectations. Inflation-linked swap forward rates had continued to gradually increase from their mid-March lows. Remarkably, this repricing had come despite the weaker macroeconomic data as well as softer than expected inflation data releases and falling commodity prices. The increase in inflation-linked swap rates could partly be attributed to rising inflation risk premia, also reflecting the fact that many commodity prices appeared to be subject to pronounced upside risks for which investors demanded compensation. Such risks also related to food prices, which were exposed to upside risks posed by Russia’s war in Ukraine as well as to a rising probability of more frequent extreme weather events occurring this year as a result of El Niño. The second factor driving up inflation compensation was the increase in expected core inflation rates.
Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation in the euro area had trended upwards since the summer of 2022, amid some volatility. The persistent upward trend of these measures was unique among major currency areas. Option prices also pointed to rising upside risks to inflation. Such elevated and rising market-based inflation expectations over the medium and long run indicated that investors may have some doubts as to whether the currently priced-in ECB policy rate path was sufficient to rein in inflation in a timely manner. Real one-year OIS rates one year ahead were currently 45 basis points below their level before the SVB collapse and were expected to remain at around 0.25% or lower over the coming years.
Ms Schnabel then turned to the market impact of some of the ECB’s recent policy decisions. As announced in February, the ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits held with the Eurosystem and for the rate on deposits of non-euro area residents held under the Eurosystem reserve management services framework had been set at a spread of 20 basis points below the euro short-term rate (€STR) from 1 May 2023. Overall, the new level of remuneration for these deposits had achieved the desired effects. Nevertheless, developments would be closely monitored to assess whether the pricing had been adequately calibrated.
Turning to the implications of the upcoming large repayments due under the targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) in June, banks were expected to predominantly draw on their excess liquidity holdings as well as on market funding. Recourse to the ECB’s regular refinancing operations – the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations – would be a natural choice for banks that required other funding sources.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Starting with the outlook for the global economy, Mr Lane recalled that, after a rebound in the first quarter of the year, global economic growth had decelerated, especially in advanced economies, and was heavily skewed towards the services sector. The gap between the global output Purchasing Managers’ Indices for the services and manufacturing sectors had reached a historical high. The euro had depreciated both against the US dollar and in effective terms since the last monetary policy meeting. Oil futures had remained broadly stable and natural gas futures prices were lower than at the time of the May Governing Council meeting. Non-energy commodity prices had declined, with both food and metal prices falling compared with the last meeting.
The euro area economy had stagnated in recent months: contracting public and private consumption and a negative contribution from inventories had only partly been offset by expanding net trade and investment. Business investment had held up in the first quarter of 2023, thanks to the easing of supply bottlenecks, as car production in particular had resumed. At the same time, survey data pointed to only a modest recovery in the second quarter of the year.
Developments had diverged sharply across sectors also in the euro area. Hard data and surveys indicated very weak activity in the manufacturing sector amid feeble demand and the running down of order backlogs. By contrast, the services sector remained resilient, still benefiting from the stimulus provided to contact-intensive services by the reopening of the economy. However, historical patterns suggested that the weakness in manufacturing could spill over to the services sector in the months ahead. One possible reason for expecting a lagged slowdown in services related to the fact that monetary policy had been shown to have a more powerful and faster effect on manufacturing than on services.
The contractionary impact of monetary policy was gradually reaching the components of aggregate demand that were typically more sensitive to interest rate changes, namely housing and business investment, as well as durable goods consumption. Expectations of higher mortgage rates weighed heavily on the perceived attractiveness of housing as an investment, while short-term indicators suggested a weakening in business investment owing to tighter financing conditions and falling orders. Consumers were also less inclined to purchase big-ticket items, and survey-based evidence suggested that a rising share of households with variable rate mortgages expected to have difficulties in making their mortgage payments on time. At the same time, private consumption was still expected to pick up, driven by remaining pent-up demand for contact-intensive services following the pandemic and by rising incomes as a result of nominal wage increases and rising employment. Looking ahead, a modest increase in exports was also expected.
The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area had revised the outlook for GDP growth downwards slightly for 2023 and 2024, while leaving it unchanged for 2025. Average annual real GDP growth was expected to slow to 0.9% in 2023 (from 3.5% in 2022), before rebounding to 1.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.
Output was expected to increase over the projection horizon. On the supply side, favourable developments included the ongoing expansion in productive capacity after the pandemic, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the expansion in labour supply (including through immigration). Demand was expected to increase owing to rising domestic incomes, underpinned by a robust labour market; the improvement in the terms of trade and the associated decline in uncertainty; and the recovery in foreign demand. At the same time, the scale of the recovery in demand would be constrained by the ECB’s policy tightening. Together with a gradual withdrawal of fiscal support, tighter financing conditions would restrict economic activity in the medium term.
Downside risks to economic growth included Russia’s war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be slower if the ECB’s monetary policy was transmitted more forcefully than expected. Renewed financial market tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and could weaken confidence. Moreover, weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area. However, growth could be higher than expected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty meant that people and businesses became more confident and spent more.
The labour market remained strong. The unemployment rate had stood at its historical low of 6.5% in April. Employment continued to benefit from a strong increase in the labour force, while demand for labour remained at high levels, including as a result of labour hoarding. At the same time, average hours worked per person employed was still somewhat below pre-pandemic levels. Wage pressures continued to strengthen, adding to underlying inflation pressures. Nevertheless, recent wage increases were broadly in line with the March staff projections and therefore had not led to a reassessment of the wage pressures for 2023 in the June projections. At the same time, in some sectors profit levels placed employers in a favourable position to absorb wage increases even as the scope for price increases declined.
There had been large increases in unit profits between the first quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2022 across all sectors, ranging from around 15% in contact-intensive services to around 23% in agriculture. In the first quarter of 2023, by contrast, some divergence had started to emerge across sectors. While the energy, utility and construction sectors had seen another strong increase in unit profits, the manufacturing sector and contact-intensive services sectors had seen declining unit profits. This implied that the sizeable wage increases had not been passed on to customers in the first quarter. This early evidence of lower unit profits in both manufacturing and contact-intensive services was consistent with the baseline assumption of declining unit profits in the June projections.
Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had declined to 6.1% in May, from 7.0% in April. Following an uptick in April, energy inflation had resumed the downward trend seen since last autumn. Food inflation was likely to have peaked in March and stood at 12.5% in May. HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX, or core inflation) had also declined for a second consecutive month, reaching 5.3% in May. In terms of pipeline pressures for food and goods inflation, there was an ongoing improvement at earlier stages of the production process. This improvement was expected to translate into a reduction in pressures from input costs over the rest of the year.
A number of indicators of underlying inflation – notably trimmed measures, exclusion-based measures and model-based indicators, such as the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) – showed signs of softening. The “Supercore” indicator and wage-sensitive components of the HICPX were levelling off, while domestic inflation was still continuing to increase, reflecting continued strong wage growth and demand for contact-intensive services. This configuration suggested that the external drivers of underlying inflation (rising energy costs and supply bottlenecks) were easing, but rising wages and ongoing effects from the reopening of the economy were still putting upward pressure on the domestic component of underlying inflation.
The different dynamics of goods inflation compared with services inflation, which were related to differences in the tradability and labour content of the different inflation components, implied that it was important to look separately at underlying measures of these two components of the HICP. For goods inflation, the Supercore and PCCI measures had both been declining, with the PCCI having been on a downward path since the end of 2022. The significant downward adjustment of the PCCI indicator largely reflected the decline in energy prices, since a large share of goods production was energy-intensive. Momentum in goods inflation was also on a downward path. By contrast, for services inflation the underlying measures and the momentum did not yet point to any visible decline. While the PCCI indicator for services had stabilised, the Supercore measure was still on an upward trend. Services inflation had declined marginally in May; however, these data were in part affected by a new, cheaper monthly ticket for public transport in Germany.
Turning to inflation expectations, respondents in the Survey of Monetary Analysts had kept their expectations for 2025 and 2026 unchanged. The Consumer Expectations Survey showed that consumer inflation perceptions and expectations had both decreased significantly in April and May after the temporary increase in March.
The June staff projections saw headline HICP inflation slightly above the path envisaged in previous exercises. Headline inflation was expected to decrease from 8.4% in 2022 to an average of 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. The downward impact from lower energy price assumptions was more than offset by upward revisions in food inflation and core inflation. Underlying price pressures remained strong. Staff had revised up their projections for core inflation, especially for this year and next year, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. The staff projections now saw core inflation averaging 5.1% in 2023, before declining to averages of 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025.
Russia’s war against Ukraine remained a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook, as it could push energy and food costs up again. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s inflation target of 2%, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recent wage agreements in a number of countries had added to the upside risks to inflation. By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to the prices of other goods and services more quickly than was currently anticipated.
Tighter monetary policy continued to be transmitted to bank funding costs. Together with increases in spreads on subordinated bank bonds and on hybrid instruments, and the increased cost of equity for banks, the impact of monetary policy tightening on the risk-free yield curve continued to drive up lending rates for firms and households. The cost of borrowing for firms had increased to 4.4% in April and mortgage rates had risen to 3.4%. Average monthly flows of lending to firms had been negative since November last year, and lending had also contracted slightly in April. Small and newer firms, which tended to be more dependent on bank credit, faced particularly steep increases in their borrowing rates and weak loan flows. Overall, the recent contraction in credit had exceeded the scale indicated by historical patterns.
The short-term dynamics of monetary aggregates had weakened further since the start of the year. The three-month annualised growth rate of M3 had been negative since the start of the year, despite the cushioning effect generated by the shift from overnight to term deposits. This development was connected with the monetary policy tightening in several ways: amid weak lending, loan flows were not supporting money growth; reducing the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet mechanically drained money from the system; banks had increased their long-term funding, mainly via bond issuance, to replace maturing TLTRO funds; and, finally, the additional issuance of government bonds was not being fully absorbed by banks, with some being absorbed by other sectors, in particular households, which had further reduced M3.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
On the basis of an assessment of the three elements of the ECB’s reaction function – the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission – Mr Lane proposed raising the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the present meeting. The profiles of headline inflation and core inflation had shifted upward in the June staff projections compared with the previous exercise, albeit only slightly for 2025. Indicators of underlying price pressures remained strong, although some showed tentative signs of softening. At the same time, the accumulated policy tightening was increasingly taking hold in the economy, as the tighter monetary policy stance seemed to be gradually felt in real activity.
Mr Lane also proposed confirming the end of reinvestments under the APP as of July. In view of the benign developments in euro area bond markets, market participants expected that reinvestments would stop. Moreover, private investors had been able to smoothly absorb the large-scale public sector issuance since the beginning of the partial APP run-off. At the same time, preserving the option to apply flexibility to reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme as a first line of defence against fragmentation risks continued to be warranted, also in view of the proposed end of APP reinvestments in July.
The current constellation of data and projections argued for continuity in communicating the Governing Council’s orientation for its next monetary policy meetings. As in May, the Governing Council needed to convey the message that future decisions would ensure that policy rates would be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the target and would be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. Emphasis on data-dependence would allow the Governing Council to adjust the course, as appropriate, in what was still a highly uncertain environment. By the July meeting, in addition to another monthly inflation data release, the Governing Council would also be able to observe the impact of the repayment of the large TLTRO III operation coming due later in June and any market effects of the end of APP reinvestments in July. In addition, there would be other evidence on the impact of the Governing Council’s measures, including new vintages of the ECB euro area bank lending survey and the Corporate Telephone Survey. The emphasis on data-dependence and a clear reaction function provided a suitable framework for reflecting this information in future policy rate decisions.
In line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council needed to assess, in depth, the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability at the present meeting. The financial stability outlook had remained challenging since the Governing Council’s last review in December 2022. Tighter financing conditions had raised the funding costs of banks and the credit risk of outstanding loans. Together with the recent tensions in the US banking system, these factors could give rise to systemic stress and depress economic growth in the short term. Another factor that weighed on the resilience of the financial sector was a downturn in the real estate markets, which could be amplified by higher borrowing costs and a rise in unemployment. At the same time, euro area banks had strong capital and liquidity positions, which mitigated these financial stability risks. Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the downward revision of expectations for foreign demand – despite the reopening of China – and for the dynamics of competitors’ import prices were two important elements in the Eurosystem staff projections. Slower increases in prices in the rest of the world would help contain pricing power and eventually dampen core inflation in the euro area. The question was raised as to whether the possible effects of the weakness of the Chinese economy had been fully taken into account in the staff projections’ outlook for euro area foreign demand and whether China might become a source of global disinflation. At the same time, it was argued that economic surprise indices for both China and the United States had been on the upside, which cautioned against assuming that world growth was set to slow. In this context, it was recalled that the growth performance of the Chinese economy would likely have repercussions for global commodity prices and thus was a key risk factor for the euro area inflation outlook. Attention was also drawn to continued high geopolitical risks, which injected uncertainty and volatility into the outlook for global activity and inflation, notably with respect to energy and food. Reference was made in this context to the recent sizeable rebound in gas prices from earlier declines.
With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane that the economy had stagnated in recent months. As in the fourth quarter of 2022, real GDP had shrunk by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023, on the back of a drop in private and public consumption. Economic growth was likely to remain weak in the short run but to strengthen in the course of the year as inflation came down and supply disruptions continued to ease. Conditions in different sectors of the economy were uneven: manufacturing continued to weaken, partly owing to lower global demand and tighter euro area financing conditions, while services remained resilient.
It was noted that the outcome for real GDP in the first quarter of 2023 implied a technical recession and was weaker than the figure embedded in the June staff projections, while not implying that the economy was facing a material contraction. In addition, the mechanical estimates presented by Mr Lane pointed to weaker than expected growth also in the current and subsequent quarters. From that perspective, the staff projections for real GDP growth of around 1% this year and 1½% in subsequent years could be on the optimistic side. The question was raised as to whether the current divergence between manufacturing and services was atypically strong, given that the performance of the services sector was still driven by a post-pandemic rebalancing of the economy.
Attention was drawn to the decline in domestic demand in the first quarter of the year, which could be seen as a sign that the tightening of monetary policy was reaching the real economy. It was suggested that transmission had been working as expected but had thus far been concealed by tailwinds for growth, owing to the financial buffers and accumulated savings available to firms and consumers, as well as to the staggered recovery from supply bottlenecks. Although still present, the support from some of these tailwinds was now fading. Looking ahead, it was argued that the baseline growth scenario in the staff projections entailed a possibly too modest, “conservative” impact from monetary policy tightening. This was because the effects of credit supply constraints and the role of quantity and non-price effects in the credit channel of transmission more broadly were typically not explicitly reflected in traditional macro models. However, it was also noted that there was little evidence of quantity restrictions in credit provision as banks were well-capitalised and profitable.
Members discussed different elements in the growth outlook and the staff projections. Supply-side bottlenecks were seen to have eased as expected, and it was noted that capacity utilisation in manufacturing was close to historical highs. This might indicate a need for additional investment over the projection horizon. In this context, reference was also made to the extra investment required to meet the EU’s 2030 climate objectives, especially in the household sector, which was estimated to amount to 2% of GDP annually in net terms. While it was possible that there would be a crowding out of investment owing to higher interest rates, it was more likely that climate-related investment was being driven by subsidies and hence would be relatively resilient to the interest rate cycle. This suggested upside risks to investment. An upside risk was also seen with regard to consumption, given the substantial accumulated savings that remained in place and the higher extra savings associated with the household saving ratio embedded in the June projections.
Members widely agreed that the labour market remained a source of strength. Almost a million new jobs had been added in the first quarter of 2023 and the unemployment rate had stood at its historical low of 6.5% in April. The average number of hours worked had also increased, although it was still somewhat below its pre-pandemic level. In this context, it was emphasised that the labour market expansion was sustained through the extensive margin, i.e. by people joining the labour force, and argued that this implied a better adjustment process than was usually the case in Europe. “Marginally attached” workers were seeking work and there was a significant reduction in the number of underemployed people. However, it was warned that strong inflows into the labour market implied some fragility, as entrants needed time to learn new jobs and therefore obtain some employment stability, which could only be ensured if the economy was not stalled by excessive tightening. The point was made that, while demographic trends were typically slow-moving, in the current post-pandemic environment of labour scarcity and rapid structural changes, the impacts of such trends on labour market developments and on wages could become visible even within a conventional projection horizon.
The role of a high level of employment in supporting aggregate demand and stronger wage pressures due to an increase in the bargaining power of workers was emphasised. As high employment was currently a manifestation of improvements on the supply side, this was consistent with expectations that there would be no material recession and that price pressures would fall over time. However, it was argued that a situation combining full employment with economic stagnation was difficult to rationalise in standard models. Accordingly, the question was raised as to whether one should not expect Okun’s law to eventually enforce some consistency between the labour market and economic activity. The same relationship could also be at work in bringing the unemployment gap into better alignment with the output gap – two measures of slack that had been misaligned in more recent times. It was argued that the potentially persistent rise in sick leave, fall in productivity and decline in average hours worked may negatively affect potential output. In this context, it was emphasised that there was a need for supply-side reforms and improvements, so that the strong labour market would be accompanied by higher productivity growth.
Members concurred that, as the energy crisis receded, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner. In doing so, they would avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for a stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make the euro area economy more productive and gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could also help reduce price pressures in the medium term. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded soon. It was felt that risks in the fiscal domain were skewed towards a later and insufficient withdrawal of stimulus in a number of jurisdictions and for the euro area as a whole.
Against this background, members concurred that the economic outlook remained highly uncertain. It was recalled that the latest GDP numbers and results from “nowcasting” models used to estimate very recent or current figures already implied a downside risk to growth relative to the June staff projections. Beyond that, downside risks to growth included Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be slower if the effects of monetary policy were more forceful than projected. Renewed financial market tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and weaken confidence. Additionally, weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area. However, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty meant people and businesses became more confident and spent more. At the same time, it was argued that some of the risk factors mentioned could also go in the opposite direction. Monetary policy could be transmitted less strongly than projected, and the world economy could grow faster than anticipated.
With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. While members considered that the second consecutive decline in core inflation was a positive signal, it was widely felt that there was as yet no sufficient or convincing evidence to confirm a turning point. It was emphasised that the momentum in price dynamics had remained strong for all components of inflation, with the exception of energy. Moreover, the outcomes for core inflation had proved stubborn and continued to be higher than projected, thus pointing to greater persistence. However, looking ahead, the degree of persistence was likely to differ across sectors – it was lower in non-energy industrial goods inflation and higher in services inflation. Clearly, the role of external shocks had already diminished and the main drivers of inflation were domestic, including a strong contribution from wages and profits. In particular, strong growth in hospitality services prices could be expected during the summer and the impact of labour costs was increasing. It was observed that, while food inflation had started to come down somewhat, it remained elevated overall, and geopolitical risks and weather and climate-related factors, including El Niño, pointed to upside risks.
However, doubts were expressed about whether a particular emphasis on core inflation was justified, as it was not seen to be a leading indicator of future headline inflation. In fact, at the current juncture, the role of unwinding energy and food inflation implied that core inflation was lagging behind headline inflation. In this context, it was recalled that, beyond core inflation, all components of headline inflation needed to be analysed and the ECB monitored a wide range of measures of underlying inflation. Moreover, it was recalled that, while some measures of underlying inflation had started to decline, others had continued to grow strongly, and that a decline in underlying inflation would not be sufficient to ensure that inflation returned to the 2% target. With respect to the June staff projections, there was broad agreement that the stubbornness of inflation and higher unit labour costs were key factors in the upward revision of core inflation, especially for 2023 and 2024. At the same time, the extent of the upward revisions to inflation was also questioned, in the light of the latest, more encouraging data and with respect to changes in the assumptions underpinning the June projections compared with the March projections, in particular the assumptions of higher interest rates, lower energy prices and an appreciation of the euro.
Regarding the projected speed of the decline in inflation, it was argued that there were clear disinflationary factors operating in the early stages of the disinflationary process. However, it was important to ask which factors would be operating towards the end of the projection horizon, and whether further disinflation would be harder to achieve the closer inflation came to 2%, since higher wage or inflation expectations could have become entrenched by then. On this point, it was recalled that the expected decline in inflation towards 2% was predicated on wage pressures abating; that, by 2025, real wages would have only barely made up their losses since 2019; and that profit margin and unit profit dynamics would reverse and act as a buffer against higher unit labour costs. This was seen as pointing to a very “narrow path” for getting close to the ECB’s target in 2025. It was mentioned that, in the United States, core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, despite reaching a turning point much earlier, was also proving to be more persistent and had repeatedly failed to come down in line with earlier Federal Open Market Committee projections.
Members widely agreed with the assessment of Mr Lane in his introduction that wage pressures, while partly reflecting one-off payments, were becoming an increasingly important source of inflation. Compensation per employee had risen by 5.2% in the first quarter of 2023 and negotiated wages had risen by 4.3%. Moreover, firms in some sectors had been able to keep profits relatively high, especially where demand had outstripped supply.
It was noted that the main problem companies were facing continued to be their capacity to hire skilled labour. As long as this remained the case, employment creation would come with wage pressures. Moreover, the wage drift between actual and negotiated wages was high, which was a reflection of the tight labour markets. Concern was expressed that protracted wage pressures would, in turn, contribute to greater persistence in domestic price pressures, notably as unit labour costs were increasing amid subdued growth in productivity and the continued pricing power of firms.
However, it was pointed out that tightness in the labour market had emerged against the backdrop of an increasing labour force, the fast creation of short-term contracts and migration, all of which were factors that tended to reduce wage pressures. New entrants tended to take jobs paying lower wages, while job movers typically took higher-quality jobs with significant wage increases. Members assessed the outlook for wages from different angles. It was acknowledged that the baseline in the June staff projections contained substantial nominal wage growth. Recent information had pointed to strong wage growth in several countries, but it was argued that outcomes were in line with the baseline projections and did not imply an upside risk. However, it was also recalled that the projections were predicated on the assumption that pressures from wage negotiations would gradually abate. Therefore, as long as this assumption was not visible in the actual data and until there was confirmation that wage pressures had run their full course, an upside risk to wage growth remained. Moreover, given staggered wage-setting and long-term contracts in Europe, the impact of higher wages would be spread over many years to come. Likewise, there was a risk that, in some countries and sectors, union bargaining might go beyond a one-off “catch-up” of real wages with respect to pre-pandemic levels and try to make up for the trend decline in the wage share incurred during past decades.
Nominal wage growth was expected to remain well above its historical average according to the June staff projections. However, it was suggested that, for the time being, this growth could still be considered moderate when viewed against the expectation that real wages would only make up their losses and return to pre-pandemic levels by 2025. While there was currently no evidence of significant second-round effects or a wage-price spiral, a note of warning was given not to underestimate the risk. After all, price levels would remain high even as inflation came down. Whether a wage-price spiral were to unfold would ultimately depend on the ability and willingness of firms to absorb higher unit labour costs in their profit margins. This, in turn, would depend on the economic environment in which firms operated, and hence on monetary policy. In this context, it was reiterated that the high levels of inflation should not lead to tit-for-tat strategies where workers and businesses sought full compensation for price and cost increases respectively. It was recalled that the euro area had been hit by a terms-of-trade shock and policymakers should communicate that, under such conditions, it would be self-defeating for social partners to aim for full compensation. In a number of smaller countries, high wage growth and high inflation had started raising concerns about a revaluation of the real exchange rate and a loss of competitiveness relative to peers. It was suspected that, in the future, this could also become an issue at the euro area level.
Profits had played an important role in recent developments in output prices, and it was noted that, in the staff projections, the decline in inflation rested on the assumption that margins would shrink. This assumption was considered to be in line with past cyclical behaviour of margins in relation to labour cost developments. However, there was no evidence yet to provide reassurance that profits would revert to earlier patterns in the post-pandemic environment, and profit dynamics had already been strong for some time, notwithstanding variations in activity. It was argued that, ultimately, the behaviour of margins depended on the evolution of pricing power. The more resilient the economy remained, the bigger the risk that firms would pass the higher unit labour costs on in their prices rather than absorb them through lower profit margins.
As regards inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based indicators. Although most measures currently stood at around 2%, some indicators remained elevated and needed to be monitored closely. It was pointed out that market-based measures stood clearly above 2%, but were close to 2% when corrected for risk premia. However, the argument was made that the measures, while likely still broadly anchored, were standing at levels that would previously have been considered worrying and that the trend was pointing upwards.
Comfort was drawn from the better news coming from the declining medium-term inflation expectations in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey. At the same time, reference was made to the qualitative data in the European Commission’s consumer survey, which showed an unusual gap between inflation perceptions and actual inflation. This suggested that there continued to be a risk of an upward shift in inflation expectations, also in view of the long period of above-target inflation, despite the recent sharp decline in inflation. It was argued in this respect that, ultimately, inflation expectations mattered to the extent that they changed actual behaviour and then showed up in wage or price-setting in the real economy.
Against this background, members considered that there were both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook. Upside risks to inflation included potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, also related to Russia’s war against Ukraine. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recent wage agreements in a number of countries had added to the upside risks to inflation. By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated.
A range of views were expressed on the risk assessment with respect to the path for inflation. Significant upside risks to headline and core inflation were seen as stemming from greater persistence and strong wage dynamics over the entire projection horizon. Specific upside risks were associated with food commodity price assumptions, possibly lasting damage to supply capacity from hysteresis effects, not sufficiently restrictive fiscal policy and weaker than projected monetary policy transmission. It was acknowledged that past forecast errors and their implications for increased inflation persistence had partly been incorporated into the baseline, but it was considered that the typical correlation of forecast errors over time still implied an upward risk in the period ahead. At the same time, it was argued that the latest evidence on strong wages and high labour costs had already been largely incorporated into the baseline projections and could therefore no longer be considered an upside risk.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members generally concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. The impact of monetary policy tightening on credit and monetary dynamics was judged to be sizeable. Weak bank lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet had led to a continued decline in annual broad money growth. Credit dynamics had weakened further, owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply conditions and lower loan demand. It was maintained that the speed and extent of the contraction in lending could not be fully explained by the increase in policy rates alone or by fundamentals such as economic activity. A view was expressed that credit weakness pointed to increasing risks of an unwarranted intensification of the transmission of the monetary policy stance through the banking sector.
The view was, however, also expressed that credit had remained relatively resilient in the face of sharp rate increases, and the contraction could be explained largely by weaker loan demand rather than by credit supply constraints. It was maintained, moreover, that the credit weakness had been driven mostly by a decrease in short-term loans that firms had used to finance increased working capital needs related to the earlier energy price shock. Doubts were expressed as to whether the weakness in credit exceeded the scale indicated by historical patterns, as such a comparison depended on the period considered as well as on other parameters included in the analysis. Due account needed to be taken of stocks and flows in credit, as well as the associated accumulated liquidity. The view was held that, in response to high inflation, the loan gap, i.e. the deviation of bank credit from a path that would be consistent with past cyclical patterns, tended to first decrease and only later to increase; therefore, it did not provide a reliable measure of credit supply restrictions in an inflationary environment.
Furthermore, it was underlined that the euro area banking sector had weathered the turmoil in March relatively well and was profitable. It was noted that, according to ECB Banking Supervision, bank profitability had developed in a benign way since monetary policy tightening had started, which should support bank lending capacity. Moreover, according to the survey on the access to finance of enterprises, firms still had ample cash owing to the pandemic support measures, which should attenuate concerns that credit demand was not being met. Attention was drawn to the forthcoming releases of the bank lending survey and the Corporate Telephone Survey, which would shed light on these developments.
At the same time, it was widely acknowledged that funding conditions had tightened for banks and credit was becoming more expensive for firms and households. Borrowing costs and non-price conditions for firms appeared to have adjusted faster than in previous tightening episodes. Regarding bank lending rates, the concern was expressed that possible bank funding tensions and increasing credit risk perceptions might translate into tighter financing conditions than those reflected in the staff macroeconomic projections. In this context it was underlined that credit conditions had been affected not only by the increase in the ECB’s policy rates, but also by the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, particularly against the backdrop of the coming TLTRO III repayments in June.
It was noted that the rapid pace of policy rate hikes was reducing borrower creditworthiness and increasing banks’ risk perceptions, as signalled in the bank lending survey, which could be expected to dampen lending significantly. The concern was voiced that the credit tightening – in particular the consequences of the reduction in households’ net disposable income caused by higher debt servicing costs for variable rate mortgage loans – had not yet fully filtered through to the real economy. In jurisdictions with a prevalence of fixed rate mortgages, the impact of higher rates was more muted and was materialising mainly via the flow of new lending, rather than the stock of outstanding mortgages. It was argued that long rate fixation periods for mortgage debt, the slow rise in deposit rates and still high levels of excess savings were mitigating or slowing the transmission of tighter lending conditions to households. It was recalled that the share of fixed rate mortgages had increased across a number of jurisdictions during the period of low interest rates, likely dampening monetary policy transmission compared with historical precedents.
The Governing Council held its biannual structured exchange on the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. Members concurred that the financial stability outlook had remained challenging since the last review in December 2022, as tighter financing conditions were raising the funding costs of banks and the credit risk of outstanding loans. In this context, there was seen to be a risk that excessive monetary policy tightening could hamper the smooth transmission of monetary policy and increase fragmentation risks. Another factor weighing on the resilience of the financial sector was a downturn in the real estate markets, which could be amplified by higher borrowing costs and a rise in unemployment. At the same time, confidence was expressed that euro area banks had strong capital and liquidity positions, and that macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members overall assessed financing conditions to have tightened since the May monetary policy meeting, with past policy rate increases being transmitted forcefully to financial and financing conditions. It was noted, however, that long-term real bond yields were back to the levels that had prevailed at the beginning of the year. Market expectations regarding the policy rate path, as embedded in forward curves and revealed in surveys, had also remained relatively stable since the previous meeting, broadly pricing in two rate increases of 25 basis points for the Governing Council’s June and July meetings.
Against this background, it was argued that market participants would be surprised by the upward revision of inflation, and particularly core inflation, in the June staff projections. This could trigger a repricing of the forward curve. The view was held that the level of the peak deposit facility interest rate, as well as its duration, as embodied in the forward curve and reflected in the staff projections, could be judged as insufficient to bring inflation back to the 2% medium-term target, as the projections showed inflation still lying above 2% in 2025. However, it was also underlined that the forward curve embedded in the staff projections foresaw interest rate cuts by the ECB in the first half of 2024, in line with the Survey of Monetary Analysts. As policy rates were approaching the peak of the interest rate cycle, the trade-off perceived by market participants between the level of the peak rate and its duration was seen as becoming more important. However, it was also argued that as long as the prospects for higher and more persistent policy rates were not priced into the term structure of market interest rates, that policy path would not be reflected in financing conditions.
In accordance with the three main elements of its reaction function that the Governing Council had communicated earlier in the year, members evaluated developments since the previous monetary policy meeting related to the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that, with the upward revision of the inflation path in the June staff projections, inflation was still projected to remain too high for too long, calling into question whether it was returning to target in a timely manner. With upside revisions to both headline and core inflation, the return to target had again been pushed out further into the future. Moreover, upside risks to the inflation outlook were judged to still prevail, mainly owing to more persistent wage-price dynamics than those incorporated into the projections. In addition, it was recalled that, for the inflation projections to materialise, the Governing Council had still, as a minimum, to deliver two successive interest rate increases in June and July, which were embodied in the assumptions on which the projections were based.
It was also argued that bringing inflation down from very high numbers to more moderate levels was easier than achieving a full return to the 2% medium-term target. In this context, it was remarked that an envisaged return of inflation to 2% towards the end of 2025 could be considered too late, because risks could materialise in the meantime that might keep inflation above the 2% target. It was seen as important for the Governing Council to stress the symmetry of its inflation objective, i.e. that upward and downward deviations from 2% were regarded as equally undesirable. Moreover, a scenario with high inflation and high interest rates was seen as possible if interest rates did not become and stay sufficiently restrictive.
In contrast, it was also maintained that the staff projections, as well as the latest inflation data, showed that the initial supply-side drivers of inflation were gradually waning, although demand-side factors were gaining importance. Headline inflation had been on a declining path since October 2022 and was projected to fall further throughout the projection horizon. Moreover, the most recent incoming data had been in line with the Governing Council’s expectations, strengthening confidence that monetary policy was on the right track. At the same time, the prevailing high level of uncertainty was underlined.
It was seen as important that the Governing Council’s response to the upward revision of the inflation outlook should not be perceived as a change in its reaction function, but rather as an appropriate response within the parameters of the reaction function. Emphasis was placed on the evidence that market-based measures of inflation compensation had edged up to above 2% and required close monitoring. In particular, longer-term market-based measures remained stubbornly high, which could partly be attributed to risk premia, suggesting that investors saw upside risks to the longer-term inflation outlook prevailing over downside risks. By contrast, several survey-based indicators of inflation expectations had stabilised or even decreased. Weighing up the different elements, inflation expectations were assessed to be still broadly anchored, as evidence was emerging that wage and price-setting behaviour in several euro area countries had started to moderate.
In this context, the weight that was attached to the staff macroeconomic projections, as opposed to actual data, when assessing the monetary policy stance was discussed. On the one hand, it was argued that the Governing Council should focus more on data than on the projections when assessing the inflation outlook. It was argued that attaching more weight to observable data would improve policy decisions, in particular when uncertainty was high. On the other hand, it was maintained that the projections were an important and useful input into the Governing Council’s decision-making. They provided discipline and a crucial benchmark for the deliberations and could be scrutinised but should not be disregarded.
Members also assessed the level and persistence of underlying inflation as being a source of concern. Core inflation had again been revised up significantly in the June staff projections. It was cautioned that strong wage growth was becoming a key driver of inflation, and convincing evidence that underlying inflation had peaked was still lacking, as had been underlined by the President during her recent appearance at the European Parliament. It was highlighted, however, that according to recent data releases core inflation had stabilised and might have reached a turning point, although it was likely to be some time before underlying inflation measures embarked on a steady path of decline.
In this context, it was argued that the Governing Council should not put too much emphasis on the behaviour of core inflation, as its mandate related to headline inflation. Moreover, core inflation did not represent the household consumption basket and had historically not been a good leading indicator of future headline inflation in the euro area.
Finally, turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members generally concurred that interest rates had reached restrictive territory, while it remained unclear at what point the stance would become sufficiently restrictive. There was evidence that the tighter policy stance was being transmitted to financing conditions, credit volumes and the real economy, while the strength of transmission and the ultimate lags in transmission to inflation remained variable and uncertain. Higher borrowing rates were seen to be contributing to a softening in demand, which was required to dampen the underlying inflation dynamics. Moreover, the point was made that the tightening impact of interest rate increases was subject to uncertainty regarding the “neutral rate”, which might be pushed up by structural changes in the labour markets and could itself be affected by monetary policy. In this context it was argued that adjustments towards a better functioning labour market needed time to unfold and would benefit from a gradual and cautious conduct of monetary policy.
The transmission of monetary policy was observed to vary across euro area countries, as institutional arrangements as well as fiscal and other national policies differed. Hence, inflation was reacting to the tightening of the monetary policy stance with different lags across countries. It was also cautioned that, as the increase in policy rates had been unprecedentedly fast, the effects of past rate hikes could still be expected to materialise and exert a downward impact on growth and inflation. The argument was made, however, that if inflation expectations started to shift upwards in response to the prolonged period of high inflation, monetary policy would be transmitted less forcefully. Moreover, a higher share of services in HICP implied that changes in interest rates were slower to affect aggregate inflation. All in all, the uncertainty about the transmission of monetary policy was very high, as shown by the substantial differences in estimated effects across models.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Against the background of these considerations around the Governing Council’s reaction function, members agreed that tightening the monetary policy stance by increasing interest rates further was warranted. While past rate increases were being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions and were gradually having an impact across the economy – tighter financing conditions being a key reason why inflation was projected to decline further towards the 2% medium-term target – inflation was still projected to remain too high for too long.
The argument was made that in view of the worsened inflation outlook a strong signal was needed, also considering that past decisions had not been decisive enough to bring inflation back to the 2% target more quickly. Looking ahead, however, it was also maintained that continuing on a gradual tightening path would allow the Governing Council to monitor and assess the impact of past monetary policy decisions and ensure that financial conditions were adjusting in a way that was consistent with inflation moving back to the 2% medium-term target. Emphasis was put on the need to be sufficiently restrictive and persistent in the monetary policy tightening. It was seen as essential to communicate that monetary policy had still more ground to cover to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner. The view was held that the Governing Council could consider increasing interest rates beyond July, if necessary.
A very broad consensus supported the 25 basis point rate increase proposed by Mr Lane, while a preference was also initially expressed for raising the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in view of the risk of high inflation becoming more persistent. Emphasis was put on the merit of sticking to a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach in an uncertain environment, particularly as rates were moving closer to a possible peak level.
A very broad consensus also prevailed in favour of confirming the end of reinvestments under the APP as of July, as proposed by Mr Lane, although a preference was also expressed for deferring the decision to a later date, after the effects of the June TLTRO III repayments on banks’ liquidity had been assessed. Overall, euro area bond markets were considered to have functioned smoothly since the beginning of the partial APP run-off. Moreover, the end of reinvestments, as signalled at the Governing Council’s previous meeting, was expected by market participants. It was noted, however, that the end of reinvestments would coincide with the June TLTRO III repayments, which would remove large amounts of excess liquidity from the system.
It was noted that, in view of the discontinuation of reinvestments under the APP, the Governing Council should discuss whether further climate-related measures should be considered to ensure that the measures were fit for purpose and aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives.
Members generally agreed that the data-dependent approach to monetary policymaking, combined with the communication on the ECB’s reaction function, had served the Governing Council well and should be reconfirmed. At the same time, it was remarked that, while the Governing Council might need to continue with additional interest rate steps, it would also have to be prepared to stop raising rates if required to do so by data and judgement.
By July, and even more so by September, new information would become available that would allow the Governing Council to update its assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. In this context, a data-dependent approach and meeting-by-meeting optionality were seen as essential.
It was also felt that the Governing Council should stress that fiscal policy needed to be tightened in order to dampen demand and support the disinflation process.
Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

Euro area firms signalled a continued increase in turnover, while higher labour, production and interest costs weighed on their profitability. Turnover is expected to increase further over the next six months.
Lack of skilled labour and rising input costs were widely reported as the main concerns.
Over the next year, firms expect their selling prices and wage costs to increase on average by 6.1% and 5.4%, respectively.
A comprehensive indicator of how firms perceive financing conditions shows a continued deterioration (47%), the highest since the start of the survey in 2009.
The net percentage of firms reporting tighter price terms and conditions for bank loans reached a historical high.
In the latest round of the twice-yearly Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, covering the period from October 2022 to March 2023, firms indicated a continuing improvement in business activity, with increased turnover reported more frequently among large enterprises than among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chart 1).
A net

16% of SMEs reported a deterioration in profits, while large firms signalled no change in profits on balance. Lower profitability reflects a rise in the cost of labour, with the net percentage of firms reporting an increase in labour costs (77%) reaching a new historical peak in the survey. The net percentage of firms indicating a rise in costs for materials and energy (89%) remained high, although it was slightly below the figure reported in the previous survey round. This reflected an easing in supply bottlenecks, along with falling energy prices. Increasing interest expenses also had a negative impact on profitability, with the net percentage standing at its highest level since the survey started. Increases in labour costs and interest expenses were reported more broadly by large firms than by SMEs, while the net percentage of firms indicating an increase in other costs was similar across firm sizes.
The latest survey round provides quantitative information on euro area firms’ expectations about their selling prices and wages over the next 12 months. Firms reported on average that they expect their selling prices to increase by 6.1% and their employees’ wages to rise by 5.4% over the next 12 months (Chart 2).
[

]
Labour and non-labour input costs, inflation expectations and demand conditions were reported to be the most important factors for firms’ price-setting behaviour over the next year.
Firms’ replies on external financing needs and availability continued to reflect the monetary policy tightening. Compared with the previous survey round, fewer euro area firms reported a net increase in demand for external financing across instruments, while availability deteriorated slightly. This resulted in a net 6% of firms reporting a widening of the financing gap (compared with 9% in the last survey round). The smaller increase in the financing gap was mainly due to a lower net percentage of large firms signalling a wider financing gap in this survey round (net 6%, down from 11% in the previous round, Chart 3).
In addition, euro area firms reported a tightening in financing conditions. In particular, a net 87% cited higher bank interest rates (up from 71% in the previous round), reflecting the transmission of the monetary policy tightening to the cost of borrowing for corporations. A comprehensive indicator of how firms perceive financing conditions shows a continued deterioration (47%), the highest since the start of the survey in 2009.
Despite tighter financing conditions, the net percentage of firms reporting obstacles to obtaining a bank loan remained broadly unchanged at 7%, with net percentages of 5% for large firms and 9% for SMEs.
Looking ahead, euro area firms expect a further deterioration in the availability of bank loans and credit lines in the coming six months, but expect an improvement in the availability of internal funds in net terms.
The report published today presents the main results of the 28th round of the SAFE in the euro area, conducted between 6 March and 14 April 2023 and covering the period from October 2022 to March 2023. The sample comprised 10,983 enterprises, of which 10,085 (92%) are SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant (i.e. they have used it or considered using it). Respondents replying “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-28 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2022-March 2023).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages."
,"1 Overview of the results
This report presents the main results of the 28th round of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, which was conducted between 6 March and 14 April 2023. The survey covered the period from October 2022 to March 2023. The sample comprised 10,983 enterprises in the euro area, of which 10,085 (92%) had fewer than 250 employees.

According to the survey results, euro area firms reported a continued increase in turnover and expectations of a further recovery. A net
[

33% reported increased turnover (see Chart 3 in Section 2), with the rebound still stronger for large firms than for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
However, firms saw a further deterioration in profits, with a record number reporting rising labour costs, although the net percentage of firms reporting an increase in other costs fell slightly (see Chart 3 in Section 2). In this survey round, 16% of SMEs reported a deterioration in profits in net terms, while large firms signalled no change in profits. The deterioration in profitability reflects a rise in the cost of labour, with the net percentage of firms reporting an increase in labour costs (77%) standing at a new historical peak in the survey. The net percentage of firms indicating a rise in costs for materials and energy (89%) remained high, although it was slightly below the figure reported in the previous survey round. This reflected an easing in supply bottlenecks, together with falling energy prices.
Increasing interest expenses represent a further drag on profitability, with the net percentage of firms reporting higher interest expenses reaching a historical peak in the survey (44%). Large firms (53%) were more widely affected by the increase in interest expenses than SMEs (39%).
Altogether, the share of financially vulnerable firms remained broadly unchanged (see Chart 5 in Section 2). The financial vulnerability indicator, a comprehensive indicator of firms’ financial situation
[

, suggests that 5.8% of euro area enterprises encountered major difficulties in running their businesses and servicing their debts over the past six months.
According to new quantitative ad hoc questions on euro area firms’ expectations about their selling prices and wages, firms reported on average that they expect their selling prices to increase by 6.1% and their employees’ wages to rise by 5.4% over the next 12 months (see Box 1 in Section 2).

This survey round provides quantitative information about euro area firms’ expectations regarding their selling prices and wages over the next 12 months.

Firms’ replies show considerable heterogeneity across sizes classes. SMEs expect their selling prices to increase by 6.6% over the next year on average, while the corresponding figure for large companies is 5.2%. Expected average wage increases are 5.7% and 4.9% for SMEs and large firms respectively. Labour and non-labour input costs, demand conditions and inflation expectations were reported to be the most important factors for firms’ price-setting behaviour.
Enterprises of all sizes reported that the lack of skilled labour and rising input costs were the major concerns for their business activity, while access to finance remained among the least-reported major concerns (see Chart 6 in Section 2). Over the past six months, the availability of skilled labour, signalled by 68% of firms, and higher production costs, signalled by 64% of firms, were their major concerns. A relatively low share of firms reported access to finance to be a major concern for their business (26% of firms).
Firms’ replies on external financing needs and availability continued to reflect the recent monetary policy tightening. In net terms, fewer euro area firms reported increased demand for external financing across instruments (see Table 1, columns 1-4 in this section and Chart 7 in Section 3.1). A net 4% of companies reported higher demand for bank loans (down from 9% in the previous survey round), while 13% reported higher demand for credit lines (down from 16%). This development is consistent with the slowdown of bank lending to firms recorded between the last quarter of 2022 and March 2023 and in line with the trend observed in the bank lending survey (BLS).
[

]
It is also related to the lower percentage of firms having used external finance for inventories as supply constraints eased. The reduced increase in the demand for external financing was also reported for trade credit, leasing and equity and, in general, was signalled more often by large firms than by SMEs.
In addition, euro area firms reported that the availability of external financing had deteriorated slightly (see Table 1, columns 5-8 in this section and Chart 9 in Section 3.2). Specifically, firms reported (in net terms) a decline in the availability of bank loans (-5%) and credit lines (-2%), approximately as in the previous round.
As a consequence of the interaction between financing needs and the availability of external finance, the financing gap across all financial instruments (bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance) increased slightly across firms (see Table 1, columns 9-10 in this section and Chart 10 in Section 3.2). The net percentage of firms reporting a widening of the financing gap in external funds went down to 6% from 9%. This was mainly because of a reduction in the net percentage of large firms reporting a widening of the financing gap (to a net 6%, down from 11% in the previous round).
Table 1
Latest developments in SAFE country results for euro area firms
(net percentages of respondents)
Notes: For the “financing gap”, see the notes to Chart 10; for “financing obstacles”, see the notes to Chart 13. “2022 H1” refers to round 27 (April 2022-September 2022) and “2022 H2” refers to round 28 (October 2022-March 2023).
The general economic outlook as a factor explaining the availability of external financing was broadly perceived as deteriorating, but less than in the previous survey round (see Chart 11 in Section 4). A net 35% of firms reported a deterioration in the general economic outlook, down from the peak of 48% in the last survey round. Similarly, the firm-specific outlook has also worsened, with a net 3% of firms reporting a deterioration, down from a net 16% in the last survey round.
Firms’ perceptions on banks’ willingness to lend, which reflect banks’ risk aversion, were broadly unchanged overall (see Chart 11 in Section 4). On balance, 3% of firms reported an improvement in the willingness of banks to provide credit, up from 0% in the previous survey round. While SMEs reported that banks’ willingness to lend was broadly unchanged (-1%), a net 9% of large firms signalled a more benign attitude among banks.
In this survey round, most enterprises reported increases in bank interest rates and a considerable deterioration in other costs of financing, with net percentages at the highest levels observed since the survey began in 2009 (see Chart 14 in Section 4). In particular, a net 87% of firms reported rises in bank interest rates (up from 71%), reflecting the transmission of the monetary policy tightening to the cost of borrowing for corporations. This is in line with the latest available results of the BLS showing a widening of the margins applied to bank loans for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.
Changes in financing conditions and the attitude of lenders normally have an impact on investment in fixed assets (see Chart 1 in this section). From a historical perspective, regression analysis shows that an increase in the level of interest rates as recorded in the SAFE and a deterioration in banks’ willingness to lend is associated with weaker fixed investment by firms. The impact of an increase in interest rates is found to be negative and statistically significant for all firms, in particular large ones, as well as for those in the industry and trade sectors. Banks’ willingness to lend, as measured by firms’ perceptions of the overall attitude of banks towards providing them with credit, has a stronger negative impact on fixed investment compared with the impact of interest rates.

The right panel plots regression coefficients showing the impact of an increase in the level of interest rates and a deterioration in banks’ willingness to lend on the increase in the purpose of using financing for fixed investment (investments in property, plant or equipment). Regressions contain firm fixed effects, and depending on the sample used, country, time, firm size and industry fixed effects. The whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals.
Few firms reported obstacles to obtaining a bank loan. Despite the tighter financing conditions, the overall indicator
[

]
of financing obstacles remained unchanged at 7%, with net percentages of 5% for large firms and 9% for SMEs (see Table 1, columns 11 and 12 in this section). In addition, even though the percentage of firms applying for bank loans remained unchanged (29%), an increasing number of firms were successful in obtaining the full amount requested, whether they were SMEs (68%) or large companies (85%).
An overall indicator of financing conditions showed the highest deterioration since the start of the survey (see Chart 2 in this section). A comprehensive indicator capturing changes in bank interest rates and other costs of bank financing (charges, fees and commissions) shows that the recent deterioration (denoted by positive indicator values) is reported by a net 47% of firms.
[

]
This recent deterioration in financing conditions is more pronounced in Spain and Italy than in other countries but is similar across firm size classes.

Base: All enterprises in all survey rounds.
Notes: Indicator obtained by factor analysis. Positive values indicate a deterioration in firms’ financing conditions. The individual scores are weighted by size class, economic activity and country to reflect the economic structure of the underlying population of firms. The individual scores are standardised, so they have a range of between -1 and 1 and are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted balances in percentages. The first vertical grey line denotes the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions; the second vertical grey line denotes the start of the first series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO I) and the negative interest rate policy; the third vertical grey line denotes the start of TLTRO II and the corporate sector purchase programme; the fourth denotes the start of the pandemic emergency purchase programme and TLTRO III; the last vertical grey vertical line denotes the raising of the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and the approval of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in July 2022. Latest observation: October 2022 to March 2023.
Looking ahead, firms expect a decline in the availability of bank loans and credit lines (see Chart 15 and Chart 16 in Section 5). Regarding external financing, firms are particularly pessimistic about access to bank loans and credit lines, with a net 17% and 12% of firms respectively expecting a deterioration over the next six months. In line with a higher net percentage of firms expecting an increase in turnover over the next six months, firms expect an improvement in the availability of internal funds.
2 The economic situation of euro area firms
2.1 Business activity continues to improve, with higher costs weighing on profitability
Euro area enterprises reported an increase in turnover over the last six months (see Chart 3). The net percentage of euro area firms that reported an increase in turnover over the last six months rose to 33% (up from 29% in the previous wave). Across firm sizes, the rebound continues to be stronger for large firms (54%) than for SMEs (21%).
Chart 3
Changes in the income situation of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 3-28 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2022-March 2023) for all firms and to rounds 21-28 (April 2019-September 2019 to October 2022-March 2023) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: Net percentages are the difference between the percentage of enterprises reporting an increase for a given factor and the percentage reporting a decrease. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
Despite the positive developments in turnover, euro area firms continued to report a deterioration in their profits, although to a lesser extent than in the previous survey round. The net percentage of euro area corporations that signalled a decline in their profits was slightly below the net percentage reported in the previous survey round (-10% compared with -16% in the previous wave). For SMEs, the respective percentages were -16% and -19%, whereas large firms signalled no changes in profits in this round (0% following -9% in the previous survey round). Firms in industry, construction and trade reported a decline in profits more often than firms in services.
The deterioration in profitability continues to reflect a significant rise in labour and other costs related to materials and energy, with the net percentage of firms reporting an increase in labour costs standing at a new historical peak in the survey. A net 77% of firms reported higher labour costs (up from 71%). The net percentage of firms indicating rising costs for materials and energy, while remaining high, stood slightly below the values reported in the previous survey round (89%, after 93%), reflecting an easing in supply bottlenecks and falling energy prices.
Increasing interest expenses represent a further drag on profitability. The net percentage of firms reporting rising interest expenses was the highest since the beginning of the survey. A net 44% of firms reported higher interest expenses (up from 30%), with large firms (53%) more widely signalling that they were affected by the increase in interest expenses than SMEs (39%).
Across countries, trends in firms’ business activity followed similar patterns in the past six months (see Chart 18 in Annex 1). The net shares of firms reporting an expansion in turnover and a decline in profits respectively were fairly similar across the largest euro area countries. Changes in labour costs were similar across the large countries, except in the case of Italy, where increases were less frequently reported (net 55% compared with 77% for all euro area firms). As in recent waves, increases in interest expenses were reported more frequently by Spanish and Italian firms (53% and 50% respectively) than by French and German firms (42% and 38% respectively).

(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 11-28 of the survey (March 2014-September 2014 to October 2022-March 2023) for all firms and to rounds 21-28 (April 2019-September 2019 to October 2022-March 2023) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: See the notes to Chart 3. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
Euro area firms reported on balance that debt-to-assets ratios were broadly unchanged in this survey round, although patterns diverged to some extent across euro area countries (Chart 4 above and Chart 19 in Annex 1). In this survey round, euro area firms indicated on balance that there had been a 1% decrease in their indebtedness (compared with no change on net in the previous round). However, German and Spanish firms continued to report slight decreases in debt-to-assets ratios, while French and, in particular, Italian firms signalled increases (although less so than in the previous round).
Firms’ investment and employment growth has broadly held up, but with some heterogeneity. A net percentage of euro area enterprises reported increases in fixed investment (15%, up from 12%), inventories and working capital (17%, as in the previous round) and number of employees (16%, up from 14%). The growth in fixed investment, inventories and employment was more widely reported among large firms than among SMEs.
Growth in inventories and working capital was widespread across countries. In this survey round, German firms continued to report increases in inventories (25%) more broadly than firms in the other large countries (ranging from 9% to15%). At the same time, increases in fixed investment were signalled more often by Spanish and Italian firms (19% and 20% respectively) than by German and French firms (10% and 13% respectively).
The financial vulnerability of euro area enterprises remained broadly unchanged for both SMEs and large firms (see Chart 5). The financial vulnerability indicator, a comprehensive indicator of firms’ financial situation, suggests that 5.8% of euro area enterprises encountered major difficulties in running their businesses and servicing their debts over the past six months (compared with 5.5% in the previous round).
[

]
The increase in this survey round is more marked for SMEs, with the percentage reaching 6.4% (up from 5.9%), well above the average levels before the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. At the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of financially strong firms (i.e. those that are more likely to be resilient to adverse shocks) remained broadly unchanged at 4.4% overall (3.9% previously), reflecting the better economic performance of large firms.

The financial vulnerability indicator increased for Spanish firms in particular (see Chart 20 in Annex 1). The percentage of vulnerable companies remained roughly constant in Germany (5%), Italy (5%) and France (4%), while it increased markedly in Spain (9%, up from 7%). By contrast, the share of strong enterprises increased slightly across the four largest economies in this survey round.
Box 1
Ad hoc questions – Firms’ expectations about selling prices and wages
The latest survey round provides quantitative information on euro area firms’ expectations about their selling prices and wages over the next 12 months. The survey included two ad hoc questions on firms’ subjective expectations about the change in (i) their selling prices and (ii) the wages of their current employees over the next 12 months. Firms’ expectations about their future selling prices reported here cannot be compared with commonly used measures of consumer price inflation expectations, as the firms’ responses mainly reflect producer prices.
On average, euro area firms expect their selling prices to increase by 6.1% and their employees’ wages to rise by 5.4% over the next 12 months, with considerable heterogeneity across firms (Chart A).
[

]
SMEs expect their selling prices to increase by 6.6% over the next year on average, while the corresponding figure for large companies is 5.2%. In the case of expected average wage increases, the numbers are 5.7% and 4.9% for SMEs and large firms respectively. Dispersion is also higher among SMEs: 50% of SMEs expect wage increases of between 3% and 8% over the next 12 months, while the respective percentages for large firms are 3% and 6%. Compared with March 2022, fewer companies expect increases in their selling prices in the next 12 months (68% of all firms compared with 76% in 2022).

Notes: Average expectations about selling prices and wages of current employees for the next 12 months as reported by euro area firms, along with interquartile ranges, using survey weights. The statistics are computed after trimming the data at the country-specific 1st and 99th percentiles.
In the current environment, labour and non-labour input costs, demand conditions and inflation expectations are reported as the most important factors for firms’ price-setting behaviour over the next 12 months (Chart B). As many as 95% of firms reported expected labour costs to be a (moderately or very) important driver of selling prices over the next 12 months. Turning to raw material and other expected input costs, and to demand conditions, around 90% of firms reported both factors to be important. In addition, 92% of firms reported that expected inflation dynamics are an important factor for their price setting. This percentage is slightly higher than in the survey round one year ago when the same ad hoc question was last asked.
Chart B
Factors reported to influence selling prices
(percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to survey rounds 22 (October 2019-March 2020), 26 (October 2021-March 2022) and 28 (October 2022-March 2023).
Notes: Importance of factors for selling prices over the next 12 months as reported by euro area firms. The most recent survey was conducted between 6 March and 14 April 2023. The chart also shows the responses from previous survey rounds to the same question.
Regression analysis suggests that demand, input costs and inflation expectations are positively related to firms’ expected selling prices over the next 12 months (Chart C). Accounting for firm size, sector and country fixed effects, and based on bivariate regressions, expected price changes are 1.5-2.5 percentage points higher for firms which report that non-labour input costs, labour costs, demand conditions or inflation expectations are important for their price setting compared with firms that do not consider these drivers important. In addition, expected price changes are 0.6 percentage points higher for firms reporting financing costs to be an important factor for price setting. These findings are similar across SMEs and large firms, and indicate that the developments in demand, energy prices and other input costs, wage developments and overall inflation expectations are important determinants of firms’ selling prices.

The whiskers represent 90% confidence intervals based on two-way clustered standard errors by country and sector.
2.2 Euro area enterprises remain more concerned about staff availability and costs than about access to finance
The availability of skilled labour and the rise in production costs continued to be the major concerns limiting production (see Chart 6). Over the past six months, the availability of skilled labour remained the most widely reported major concern (defined as a score of at least seven on a scale of one to ten) among euro area firms (signalled by 68% of firms), in line with the recent signals of a robust labour market, with labour shortages seen as limiting production. High production costs also remained a major concern (indicated by 64% of firms). This percentage was almost unchanged from the previous survey round, most likely related to the recent declines in energy prices. Across size classes, these two concerns are reported more often by large companies than by SMEs.
A relatively low share of firms reported access to finance as a major concern for their business (see Chart 6). Around 26% of firms reported access to finance as a major concern for their business. Across size classes, a similar share of firms reported access to finance as a major problem (27% for larger firms and 26% for SMEs).

3 Demand for and availability of external financing
3.1 Increased demand for external financing across instruments
Euro area firms reported increased demand for external financing, although fewer firms reported higher demand than in the last survey round (see Chart 7). A net 4% of companies reported higher demand for bank loans
[
11
]
(down from 9% in the previous survey round), while 13% reported increased demand for credit lines (down from 16%). Among the largest euro area countries, a higher net share of French and Italian firms (both 9%) reported an increase in the need for bank loans (see also Chart 25 in Annex 1). The overall deceleration in financing needs is consistent with the slowdown in bank lending to corporates observed between the fourth quarter of 2022 and March 2023. It is also in line with the trend observed in the BLS for the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023. In net terms, firms also reported a deceleration in demand for trade credit, leasing or hire-purchase, and equity. The deceleration in demand for external financing was more pronounced for large firms than SMEs for most instruments.

Notes: See the notes to Chart 3. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 of the survey.
3.2 Firms used financing primarily for fixed investment and for inventories and working capital
Financing from external and internal sources continued to be used mainly for fixed investment and for inventories and working capital (see Chart 8). Fixed investment was still reported as the most common purpose of financing (45% of firms), with the percentage being slightly higher than in the last survey round (42%). The second most common purpose of financing was reported to be inventories and capital (37%), although the percentage declined for the second consecutive wave. In particular, fewer large companies reported inventories and capital to be a purpose of their financing (down to 45% from 51% in the last round), and the decline was widespread across euro area countries (see Chart 23 in Annex 1). The decline in the share of firms obtaining financing for inventories and capital was in line with the easing in supply bottlenecks.

Note: The data included in the chart refer to Question 6A.
3.3 Declining availability of external financing contributed to a further widening of the financing gap
Firms reported a further slight deterioration in the availability of bank loans, credit lines and debt securities, although the decline was slower than in the previous round (see Chart 9).
[
12
]
The net percentages of firms reporting a deterioration in the availability of bank loans and credit lines were 5% and 2% respectively. This was the second survey round in a row in which firms reported declining availability of bank loans and credit lines, following several rounds in which firms reported an increase in these financing sources, with the decline in the latest round being smaller than in the previous one. Across size classes, SMEs reported the availability of bank loans and credit lines to have deteriorated more broadly (net -8% and -5% respectively) than large firms (both roughly unchanged). On balance, firms also reported a further decline in the availability of debt securities (-7% compared with -24% in the previous round), with a stronger effect on large firms (-9%) than on SMEs (-5%). For the remaining sources of external finance, availability was reported to be roughly unchanged across size classes.

Changes in the availability of external financing for euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 21-28 of the survey (April 2019-September 2019 to October 2022-March 2023).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 3. The data included in the chart refer to Question 9 of the survey.
Firms’ increased needs for external finance combined with lower availability resulted in a widening of the financing gap (see Chart 10). In the euro area, the external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the supply of external financing – was reported to be 6% (down from 9% in the previous round). Apart from the previous survey wave, this was the largest increase in the financing gap since 2013. While the increase in the financing gap was similar across company size, the financing gap widened most broadly (12%) for French companies and least broadly (2%) among Italian firms (see also Chart 25 in Annex 1).

(weighted net balances)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant (i.e. they have used it or considered using it). Respondents replying “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-28 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2022-March 2023).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 and Question 9.
3.4 Euro area enterprises perceived the general economic outlook as negatively affecting the availability of external finance
The general economic outlook was broadly perceived as hampering the availability of external financing, but less than in the previous survey round (see Chart 11). Among the factors determining the availability of external financing, a net 35% of firms reported that the general economic outlook had deteriorated. This was down from the peak of a net 48% of firms in the last survey round. Likewise, the firm-specific outlook also worsened, with a net 3% of firms reporting a deterioration, compared with a net 16% in the last survey round. The pessimistic perceptions regarding the general economic and firm-specific outlook receded across size classes. By contrast, firms reported an improvement in their own capital position (net 14%, up from 10%) and creditworthiness (net 15%, up from 12%), thus continuing to have a positive impact on access to finance. For both large firms and SMEs, a larger net percentage of firms indicated an improvement in firms’ own capital and credit history, compared with the previous survey round. This may reflect the ongoing efforts of companies to restore their equity capital buffers and thus become more resilient to economic shocks.

(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 21-28 of the survey (April 2019-September 2019 to October 2022-March 2023).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 3. The data included in the chart refer to Question 11 of the survey.
Among the largest euro area countries, the most pessimistic perceptions on the general economic environment came from Spanish and French companies. In net terms, 45% of Spanish and 41% of French companies reported a negative impact from the general economic outlook on the availability of external financing. French firms were also the most pessimistic about their own outlook, while firms in Spain and Italy indicated that the firm-specific outlook had a positive impact on the availability of external financing (see Chart 26 in Annex 1).
Firms’ perceptions of banks’ willingness to lend, which reflect banks’ risk appetite, were overall broadly unchanged (see Chart 12). A net 3% of firms reported an improvement in banks’ willingness to lend, up from 0% in the previous survey round. While SMEs reported that banks’ willingness to lend was roughly unchanged on balance, a net 9% of large firms signalled an increase. Across countries, Italian and German firms reported improvements in banks’ willingness to provide credit, while French firms reported broadly no change, and Spanish firms indicated a deterioration in net terms (see Chart 27 in Annex 1).
Enterprises continued to report that public financial support had a decreasing impact on the availability of finance (see Chart 12). Reflecting the phasing-out of several support measures across the euro area, firms reported quite broadly that the role of public financial support was decreasing, with a net 11% decline (compared with a net 15% decline in the previous survey round). SMEs were more pessimistic on this than large firms. This holds across all large countries, but the perception is most widespread among Spanish firms (see Chart 27 in Annex 1).

4 Obstacles to obtaining a bank loan and financing conditions
4.1 Few firms reported obstacles to obtaining a bank loan
Despite the decline in the availability of credit, few firms reported obstacles to obtaining a bank loan, with percentages broadly similar to those of the previous survey rounds (see Chart 13, panel a). Among enterprises that judged bank loans to be relevant for their funding, 7% faced obstacles when seeking to obtain a loan, with net percentages of 5% for large firms and 9% for SMEs (see Chart 13, panel b). Across countries, looking at the different components of financing obstacles, the most notable changes were reported in France, where firms rejected banks’ offers more often because the costs of financing related to bank loans were considered too high, and in Germany and Spain, where the share of discouraged borrowers increased (see Chart 28 in Annex 1).
Chart 13
Obstacles to obtaining a bank loan
(percentages of respondents)
Panel a: Euro area enterprises
Panel b: Euro area SMEs and large enterprises
Base: Enterprises for which bank loans (including subsidised bank loans) are relevant. The figures refer to rounds 3-28 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2022-March 2023).
Note: Financing obstacles are defined here as the total of the percentages of enterprises reporting (i) loan applications that were rejected, (ii) loan applications for which only a limited amount was granted, (iii) loan applications that resulted in an offer that was declined by the enterprise because the borrowing costs were too high, and (iv) a decision not to apply for a loan for fear of rejection (discouraged borrowers).
The percentage of firms applying for bank loans remained unchanged, with the role of internal funds declining slightly. According to figures based only on enterprises that deemed bank loans to be relevant for their business, 29% of firms reported having applied for a loan (unchanged) (see Chart 29 in Annex 1). Only 22% of SMEs applied, with 44% reporting that they did not apply because they had sufficient internal funds available. By contrast, a higher percentage of large companies applied for bank loans (41%, up from 37%) in response to a depletion of internal funds. Most of the firms that applied were successful in obtaining the full amount requested, whether they were SMEs (62%) or large companies (73%) (see Chart 30 in Annex 1).
4.2 Significant tightening in financing conditions, with more stringent price terms and conditions for bank loans
Firms reported very broadly that there had been a rise in bank interest rates alongside a considerable increase in other costs of financing, with net percentages at the highest observed levels since the survey began in 2009 (see Chart 14). The net percentage of firms reporting an increase in interest rates rose further in the current survey round to 87% (up from 71%), reflecting the transmission of the monetary policy tightening to the cost of borrowing for corporations. This is also in line with the latest available results of the BLS showing a widening of margins for bank loans for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, a net 53% (up from 49%) of firms reported an increase in other costs of financing (i.e. charges, fees and commissions). As in the previous survey round, the figure represented a historical high. The rise in bank interest rates was reported more broadly by large firms, whereas the increase in other costs of bank loans was signalled more often by SMEs. Firms also reported stricter collateral requirements and increases in the maturity and size of loans.
The net percentage of firms reporting an increase in interest rates is similar across the largest euro area countries (see Chart 31 in Annex 1). The increase in interest rates was reported to be widespread across the largest euro area countries, with the figures ranging from a net 84% increase in France to a net 89% increase in Spain. Meanwhile the reported net increase in non-interest cost ranged between 44% in Germany and 66% in Spain.

5 Expectations regarding access to finance and turnover
5.1 Firms expect a further deterioration in their access to bank loans and credit lines
Looking ahead, firms expect a decline in the availability of bank loans and credit lines (see Chart 15). Reflecting the ongoing tightening in bank lending conditions, a net 17% of firms expect a deterioration in access to bank loans, while a net 12% expect a worsening in access to credit lines over the next six months. Compared with large firms, SMEs expect a slightly larger deterioration both for bank loans and credit lines. Across countries, the expected deterioration in the availability of bank loans and credit lines is more pronounced in Germany, Spain and France (see Chart 32 in Annex 1). Firms indicated no change in the expected availability of debt securities for the next six months, while large firms even expect an improvement.

Firms were optimistic about the availability of internal funds for the next six months (see Chart 16 and Chart 33 in Annex 1). Across size classes, a net 2% of SMEs and a net 4% of large firms expect internal funds as a source of financing to improve over the next six months.

Compared with March 2023:
consumer inflation expectations decreased significantly – reversing most of the increases seen in the previous month;
expectations declined for both nominal income growth and nominal spending growth over the next 12 months;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers expect lower growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead declined.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months decreased to 8.9% in April 2023, from 9.9% in March. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased to 4.1% in April, from 5.0% in March, and those for inflation three years ahead decreased to 2.5%, from 2.9% in March. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead also decreased. Thus, the increases observed in March have largely been reversed. Inflation expectations, particularly at the three-year horizon, remained well below the perceived past inflation rate. Inflation perceptions and expectations continued to be closely aligned across income classes, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) reporting lower inflation perceptions and expectations and sharper declines than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to rise more slowly, by 1.1%, compared with 1.3% in March. The decline in expected nominal income growth was concentrated in the first four quintiles of the income distribution – consumers’ expectations in the fifth (highest) income quintile were on average unchanged. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months were roughly stable compared with March, at 7.0%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months reverted close to February’s value, falling to 3.8% in April from 4.1% in March. Developments in perceptions and expectations about nominal spending growth continued to be broadly aligned across age classes. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months were less negative in April, standing at -0.8% compared with -1.0% in March. In line with expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 11.2% in April, from 11.7% in March. Consumers expected the future unemployment rate to remain higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.0%), but the gap had narrowed to some extent. Quarterly data show that in April 2023 unemployed respondents reported their expected probability of finding a job over the next three months had fallen to 26.6%, from 28.1% in January 2023. Employed respondents reported that their expected probability of losing their job over the next three months had decreased to 7.8% in April, from 8.1% in January. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
In April consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.2% over the next 12 months – the lowest value reported for two years – compared with 2.7% in March. The decline in expectations was broad-based across age and income classes. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead edged down to 5.0% in April. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months tightened compared with March, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months remained unchanged from March. The share of consumers who reported having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined to 13.4% in April from 13.6% in January 2023. This reflects a fall in new credit applications reported by younger respondents, which was partly compensated for by a rise in those reported by older respondents (aged above 34).

Number of bank offices continued to decline in most EU Member States, by 5.39% on average
Number of bank employees declined by 1.25% on average
Degree of banking sector concentration continues to differ widely across countries
The European Central Bank (ECB) has updated its dataset of structural financial indicators for the banking sector in the European Union (EU) for the end of 2022. This annual dataset comprises statistics on the number of offices and employees of EU credit institutions, data on banking sector concentration in each EU Member State and data on foreign-controlled institutions operating in the EU.
The structural financial indicators show a further decline in the number of bank offices in the EU, averaging 5.39% across Member States. Decreases were observed in 25 of the 27 countries, ranging from -0.98% to -21.54%. The total number of offices in the EU was 132,871 at the end of 2022, of which 82.8% were located in the euro area.
In the course of 2022, the number of employees of credit institutions fell in 18 EU Member States, with an average drop of 1.25% across all countries. This decline in the number of bank employees is a trend seen in most countries since 2008.
The data also indicate that the degree of banking sector concentration (measured by the share of assets held by the five largest banks) continues to vary considerably between EU Member States. At national level the share of total assets of the five largest credit institutions ranged from 31.16% (Luxembourg) to 95.72% (Greece) at the end of 2022, while the EU average was 68.27%.
The structural financial indicators are published annually by the ECB.

Tighter financial conditions test resilience of households, firms, governments and property markets
Financial markets are vulnerable to disorderly adjustments, given investment fund vulnerabilities, stretched valuations, high volatility and low liquidity
Euro area banks robust to recent stress outside the euro area, but higher funding costs and lower asset quality may weigh on profitability
According to the May 2023 Financial Stability Review published today by the European Central Bank (ECB), the outlook for euro area financial stability remains fragile, in the context of recent banking stress outside the currency union.
While economic conditions have improved slightly, uncertain growth prospects paired with persistent inflation and tightening financing conditions continue to weigh on the balance sheets of firms, households and governments. Furthermore, an unexpected deterioration in economic conditions or financial tightening could lead to disorderly price adjustments in either or both financial and real estate markets.
“Price stability is crucial for durable financial stability,” said ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos. “But as we tighten monetary policy to reduce high inflation, this can reveal vulnerabilities in the financial system. It is critical that we monitor such vulnerabilities and fully implement the banking union to keep them in check.”
Looking more closely at vulnerabilities, euro area firms face tighter financing conditions and uncertain business prospects. This could be particularly challenging for those firms that came out of the pandemic with greater debt and weaker earnings. At the same time, high inflation is hitting households – particularly those on lower incomes – by reducing their purchasing power and compromising their ability to repay loans. Demand for new loans, especially mortgages, declined sharply in the first quarter of 2023 in response to rising interest rates. While falling energy prices in recent months have reduced pressures on governments to fund additional fiscal support, public authorities nevertheless face rising funding costs.
Euro area real estate markets are undergoing a correction. In residential markets, house price increases have cooled considerably over the last few months, reducing overvaluation in the sector. While price adjustments have been orderly so far, they could turn disorderly if higher mortgage rates increasingly reduced demand. Commercial real estate markets remain in a downturn, facing tighter financing conditions and an uncertain economic outlook, as well as weaker demand following the pandemic. The ongoing correction could test the resilience of investment funds with interests in the commercial real estate sector.
Financial markets and investment funds remain vulnerable to asset price adjustments. Stretched valuations, tighter financing conditions and lower market liquidity might increase the risk of any adjustment becoming disorderly, particularly in the event of renewed recession fears. So far, investment funds have been largely unaffected by recent tensions in the US and Swiss banking sectors. This could change, however, if funds suddenly required liquidity, forcing them to sell assets quickly.
Euro area banks have also proved resilient to stresses in US and Swiss banks on account of their limited exposures. This resilience was supported by strong capital and liquidity positions resulting from regulators’ and supervisors’ efforts over recent years. It will be essential to preserve this resilience amid some concerns about banks’ ability to build up capital. For example, higher interest rates reduce lending volumes and increase banks’ funding costs, which may impair their profitability. Furthermore, there are already signs of deteriorating asset quality in loan portfolios exposed to commercial real estate, smaller firms and consumer loans. Banks may therefore need to set aside more funds to cover losses and manage their credit risks.
In this context, it is essential to complete the banking union and, in particular, to establish a common European deposit insurance scheme. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector require a comprehensive and decisive policy response in order to further increase trust in the financial system and its ability to withstand risks.

,"Foreword
This spring saw considerable financial turbulence, with the spotlight increasingly turning on systemic risk concerns following a series of bank failures outside the euro area. While the fallout experienced by euro area banks was limited, these events have served as a powerful reminder of the importance of ensuring that banking system fundamentals are sound, in an environment where financial conditions are being tightened to tackle elevated inflation around the world.
Price stability remains as crucial as ever for durably preserving financial stability. Tighter financing conditions to forcefully address high inflation have contributed to a reappraisal of the economic outlook and to a reversal of overly-compressed asset price risk premia. As financial conditions normalise, this may expose fragilities and fault lines in the financial system. Non-bank financial intermediaries remain heavily exposed to a turning financial cycle, despite ongoing de-risking. Such turning is becoming increasingly evident in the real estate sector – in both commercial property markets, where a clear downturn is visible, and their residential counterparts, which are showing signs of correction after several years of expansion. In all of these challenges, the resilience of euro area banks has been noteworthy, but should not give way to complacency.
Recent stresses in the US and Swiss banking sectors have served as a timely reminder of just how much the preservation of financial stability depends on the shock-absorption capacity of the financial system. This is especially true for banks, which operate at the core of the system. The resilience of euro area banks is largely attributable to the strength of their capital and liquidity buffers, under stringent regulatory and supervisory oversight. Strengthening the banking union – and notably making progress on a common European deposit insurance scheme – will reinforce the ability of the euro area financial system to withstand risks going forward.
Beyond the overview of key financial stability vulnerabilities in the euro area, this issue of the Financial Stability Review (FSR) includes three special features. The first examines how interactions in market and funding liquidity can amplify stress in the financial system. The second investigates the channels through which stress in non-bank financial institutions could propagate to euro area banks. The third furthers work on identifying potential threats from climate change, with a primer on associated risks for sovereigns.
This issue of the FSR has been prepared with the involvement of the ESCB Financial Stability Committee, which assists the decision-making bodies of the ECB in the ful?lment of their tasks. The FSR promotes awareness of systemic risks among policymakers, the ?nancial industry and the public at large, with the ultimate goal of promoting financial stability.

Overview
Euro area financial stability outlook remains fragile
Euro area financial stability vulnerabilities remain elevated in the context of unexpected stress in the banking sectors of some mature economies. The recent failures of a number of US regional banks and the takeover of a Swiss bank have invited closer scrutiny of bank exposure to long-term fixed income securities, the stability of wholesale uninsured deposit funding and latent business model challenges. While the immediate cause of bank stress was related to idiosyncratic bank fragility in non-euro area economies, the episode prompted more general concerns about bank resilience in an environment of higher interest rates. This led to tensions in the bank equity and funding markets in the euro area. These tensions were short-lived, as euro area bank fundamentals remain solid and prompt regulatory intervention has contained spillovers from other economies. Nevertheless, it is possible that these events could lead to a reassessment of the profitability and liquidity outlooks for euro area banks.

Despite some improvement seen at the turn of the year, weak macro-financial prospects continue to pose a challenge to financial and non-financial sectors alike. Macro-financial conditions have improved slightly since the publication of the previous Financial Stability Review (Chart 1, panel a), thanks to a robust post-pandemic recovery, fading global supply chain disruptions and lower energy prices. That said, the outlook remains highly uncertain, given the presence of downside risks to growth accompanied by persistent inflationary pressures. Also, near-term financial stress indicators have picked up again (Chart 1, panel b) in the context of stress in the banking sectors of some mature economies, although they remain below pandemic and war-related levels. At the same time, there are still structural vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector in the form of liquidity mismatch and leverage. High volatility and signs of lower market liquidity are rendering financial markets and the NBFI sector prone to adverse dynamics such as forced asset sales and are increasing the likelihood of credit events materialising. Such amplification effects could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected with regard to both the cost and the availability of credit, and could dampen confidence, potentially weakening the resilience of the non-financial sectors.
Financial markets and non-bank financial intermediaries remain vulnerable to disorderly adjustments
Following the rally in financial markets seen at the turn of the year, stresses in some mature economy banking sectors triggered price adjustments. Global financial markets saw an unusually robust start to 2023, driven by optimistic macroeconomic expectations predicated on the resilience of the euro area economy at the turn of the year, the faster than expected reopening of the Chinese economy and a sharp drop in energy prices. Solid corporate financial results, alongside lower volatility in interest rate markets, pushed euro area equity valuations back above historical averages (Chapter 2). The positive risk sentiment started to fade in February, following the more hawkish tone adopted by central banks globally. It reversed more abruptly in March, as unexpected stress in the US and Swiss banking sectors sent shockwaves through global financial markets.
The potential for disorderly adjustments in financial markets has risen in the context of tighter financial conditions and lower market liquidity. Renewed recession concerns in the aftermath of the banking sector stress in the United States and Switzerland have significantly lowered market-based policy rate expectations. Financial conditions have tightened as the market turmoil has led to a widening of credit risk premia in the euro area. By contrast, the fact that equity risk premia remain compressed in absolute and relative terms, especially in the United States (Chart 2, panel a), raises concerns over potential overvaluation. Equities may thus be more vulnerable to a disorderly price correction in the event of a further deterioration in the economic outlook (Chapter 2). As such, risk sentiment remains fragile and is highly sensitive to surprises as regards the outlook for inflation, growth and monetary policy in mature economies. More persistent inflationary pressures might require more significant monetary policy responses from major central banks than market participants currently expect. Among other things, a renewed surge in energy prices could also pose upside risks to inflation and could add to already-elevated volatility in interest rate markets (Chart 2, panel b). The combination of a tighter monetary policy environment and recession fears could put pressure on the valuations of riskier assets. At the same time, elevated volatility in interest rate markets has contributed to a substantial decline in market liquidity in both corporate and sovereign bond markets, leaving them more vulnerable to adverse dynamics (Chart 2, panel c and Special Feature A).

The non-bank financial sector has remained resilient during the recent banking sector stresses and market volatility, but liquidity and credit risks remain high. The highly volatile market conditions which followed the flare-up of banking sector stress in the United States and Switzerland resulted in funds which invest in European and US financials, as well as those exposed to riskier assets such as high-yield corporates, facing significant investor outflows after early March. At the same time, inflows into sovereign bond funds and money market funds accelerated (Chart 3, panel a), reflecting safe haven flows in an environment of elevated macro-financial uncertainty as well as higher rates offered compared with bank deposits. Shifts by investors towards safer fund types served to reduce aggregate credit risk in the sector (Section 4.2). Portfolio de-risking has also been evident on the balance sheets of insurance corporations and pension funds, as higher interest rates have reduced the incentives for the non-bank financial sector to search for yield. That said, overall exposures to credit risk remain high, exposing the non-bank financial sector to the risk of material losses should corporate sector fundamentals deteriorate substantially. In addition, non-banks’ exposure to property markets has increased markedly in recent years, rendering institutions vulnerable to ongoing property price corrections (Section 4.1 and Box 2). Strong links with banks, as an important source of funding for instance, could also give rise to additional vulnerabilities in the banking sector via liquidity and credit risk spillovers (Special Feature B).
Low liquid asset holdings and potential margin calls could pose the risk of possible forced asset sales, calling for enhanced liquidity preparedness. While increasing slightly in 2022, the share of high-quality liquid assets in investment funds’ securities holdings remains relatively low (Chart 3, panel b). As such, the risk remains high that, if they were to experience any sudden liquidity needs, funds could amplify adverse market dynamics via procyclical selling behaviour and forced asset sales, thereby introducing risks to wider financial stability. It is therefore necessary to strengthen existing regulatory frameworks and address issues related to structural liquidity mismatches in funds. Past stress events, such as the turmoil in March 2020 and the UK gilt market stress in the autumn of 2022, also vividly illustrate how non-banks can amplify margin call dynamics in the wider financial system, especially when coupled with excessive leverage. This highlights the importance of enhancing liquidity preparedness in the non-bank financial sector (Box 7).

Tighter financial conditions are testing corporate, household and sovereign resilience
Sovereign vulnerabilities have remained elevated in a context of tightening financial conditions and weak macro-financial prospects. The pressures on public finances have eased in recent months, as the big drop in energy prices has reduced the need for additional energy-related fiscal support to be provided to corporates and households. But fiscal fundamentals remain fragile in some countries given their high debt levels, rising funding costs and high short-term refinancing needs (Chart 4, panel a). Vulnerabilities associated with potential abrupt shifts in market sentiment remain contained for now, as in recent years many sovereigns have locked in cheap financing at longer maturities. In addition, the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument is able to counter any unwarranted and disorderly sovereign debt market dynamics that may pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. Foreign investors can also play a stabilising role when spreads between sovereigns become elevated, as they increase their exposures towards euro area government bond markets (Box 3). That said, interest payments are expected to increase gradually going forward, as maturing public debt is rolled over at higher interest rates (Chart 4, panel b).

Euro area firms have benefited from high profits in the context of a sharp post-pandemic recovery and lower energy prices, but rising costs are weighing on prospects. Higher revenues and profit margins have both contributed significantly to upbeat corporate financial results. In fact, many firms have been able to raise their profit margins in sectors facing constrained supply and resurgent demand, contributing to higher wage demands and, by extension, upside risks to inflation. That said, not all firms have benefited equally from the recovery. Highly indebted, energy-intensive and/or pandemic-sensitive sectors have often been unable to increase profit margins (Chart 5, panel a), with some heterogeneity across countries. At the same time, euro area firms are facing challenges from higher refinancing costs (Box 1). There are also signs of corporates switching from market-based financing to bank loans (Box 6), given the faster pass-through of policy rate increases to investment grade corporate bond yields. Looking ahead, a combination of higher financing costs and highly uncertain business prospects will weigh on the corporate sector outlook (Chart 5, panel b). In particular, a sharper economic slowdown than currently anticipated, together with a disorderly tightening of financing conditions, could prove particularly challenging for those firms that exited the pandemic with higher debt levels, subdued earnings and low interest coverage ratios. Small and medium-sized enterprises may be particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity and higher borrowing costs, as they have benefited less from the economic recovery (Section 1.3).

Notes: Panel a: a fixed sample of 1,099 euro area non-financial corporations with total assets in excess of €50 million as at Q4 2022. Indebtedness is based on pre-pandemic debt levels (Q4 2019).
In recent months, euro area households have benefited from lower energy prices and a resilient labour market, but higher interest rates are increasingly weighing on credit dynamics. Household confidence has recovered to some extent in recent months, in line with the marked drop in energy prices and the associated lower headline inflation outturns (Section 1.4). But households’ real incomes and consumption remain under pressure from persistently high inflation, especially for lower income buckets. The real income squeeze, coupled with higher interest rates, is increasingly compromising households’ debt servicing capacity, particularly in the consumer loan segment. On a positive note, resilient labour markets have so far supported incomes, and the shift towards more fixed-rate mortgage lending in recent years has shielded many households from the immediate impact of higher interest rates. The use of borrower-based macroprudential measures in most euro area countries in recent years has also helped to limit the build-up of risks. That said, vulnerabilities could resurface, should labour market conditions deteriorate or energy prices rise again.
The euro area property market cycle is turning, as higher interest rates weigh on affordability
The euro area residential real estate cycle has shifted into correction mode, compounding the vulnerabilities of euro area households. Euro area residential real estate markets cooled markedly in the second half of 2022. The easing of residential property price inflation is apparent in most euro area countries, in particular those (notably Germany) which were less affected during previous crises (Chart 6, panel a). Orderly price corrections might be warranted, as overvaluation measures have been signalling the potential for corrections in recent years. That said, looking ahead, a fall in prices could become disorderly as rising interest rates on new mortgage lending increasingly compromise affordability and increase the interest burden on existing mortgages, especially in countries where variable-rate mortgages predominate. This is also indicated by the record high number of banks– even more than during the global financial crisis – reporting a decline in the demand for mortgages in the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, euro area banks have tightened credit standards for mortgage loans considerably, against a backdrop of rising interest rates and deteriorating housing market prospects. The pace of prices falling could be further amplified in countries and regions where the presence of institutional investors is strong (Box 2).
Euro area commercial real estate (CRE) markets remain in a clear downturn. In an environment of tighter financing conditions and elevated macro-financial uncertainty, CRE valuations have continued to decline sharply. Demand has dropped significantly across both the office and the retail segments, with overall transaction volumes declining at a pace similar to that observed during the global financial crisis (Chart 6, panel b). The challenges associated with the current uncertain market environment are amplified by pandemic-induced structural changes, particularly in markets for lower quality assets where tenant demand has weakened since the pandemic (Section 1.5). While bankruptcies among CRE-exposed non-financial firms remain low, an even more pronounced adjustment in CRE markets could expose structural vulnerabilities in some open-ended property funds, increase credit risk for lenders and lower collateral values.

Euro area banks have proven resilient to bouts of bank stress in some advanced economies
Stress in the US and Swiss banking sectors has triggered concerns over the health of parts of the banking industry, although the impact has been limited in the euro area amid solid bank fundamentals. The bullish market sentiment towards euro area banks that prevailed after the publication of the previous Financial Stability Review reversed abruptly in the first half of March (Chart 7, panel a). The failure of three medium-sized banks in the United States – Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and later First Republic – as well as the takeover of Credit Suisse in Switzerland, led to broader market concerns over banks’ exposure to long-term fixed income securities, the cost and stability of deposit funding amid the growing digitalisation of banking services, business model viability and banks’ risk management practices. Euro area bank share prices fell sharply, while signs of tension became apparent in riskier bank bond markets, notably the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) segment (Chart 7, panel b), following the decision by the Swiss authorities to write down Credit Suisse Group’s AT1 instruments before its equity capital had been used up. However, given the idiosyncratic nature of the sources of US and Swiss bank stress, tensions have remained contained, and the broader implications for euro area banks have been limited. The resilience of the euro area banking sector has, in aggregate, been underpinned by strong capital and liquidity positions, and by greatly improved asset quality and profitability in recent years (Chart 7, panel c).

Bank operating profitability improved further in 2022, but the outlook has become more uncertain amid vulnerabilities in non-financial sectors. Supported by higher interest rates and low loan loss provisions, euro area banks showed robust earnings momentum throughout 2022. This is particularly true for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates. While the profitability of most euro area banks has benefited from rising interest margins, uncertainties have increased around the profitability outlook. In fact, the net interest income benefits from higher interest rates could turn out to be smaller than expected, given lower interest rate expectations more recently and a catch-up in deposit rates. Also, an environment of more muted economic growth prospects, coupled with considerably tighter credit standards and a slump in credit demand, may weigh on volume growth going forward. Furthermore, some signs of increasing credit risk are already becoming evident in loan portfolios that are more sensitive to cyclical downturns, such as those with exposures to commercial real estate, SMEs and consumer loans (Section 3.4). As a result, banks may face the risk of higher provisioning costs (which tend to increase markedly around credit events), with better-capitalised banks tending to provision significantly more than banks with less capital headroom (Box 5).
The prospects of higher bank funding costs are increasing downside risks to euro area bank earnings, while a stable deposit base is limiting funding risks. Bank bond funding costs have risen markedly since the start of 2022 on account of higher interest rates and, more recently, heightened market concerns regarding banks. As such, rolling over maturing bonds will increase banks’ market funding costs going forward. Banks could also face upward pressure on their funding costs if competition for deposits were to rise and translate into faster deposit repricing (Box 4). In particular, in countries where fixed-rate loans predominate, higher funding costs make it more challenging for banks to fund low-yielding assets until maturity. That said, standard regulatory metrics suggest strong liquidity resilience overall, despite a recent decline in the funding liquidity of banks (Special Feature A). Unrealised mark-to-market losses on bond holdings are limited (Chart 8, panel a), given the relatively low share of bond holdings in total assets, and are fully reflected in regulatory liquidity ratios. Securities held at amortised cost can be used to obtain secured funding, including through ECB operations, without crystallising the valuation losses. Banks’ vulnerability to liquidity shocks is further mitigated by composition of high-quality liquid assets, which consist largely of reserves held with the ECB. In aggregate, euro area banks do not share the funding vulnerabilities which have contributed to recent US and Swiss bank failures. They are funded mainly by deposits, with retail customers providing the majority of all deposits. In addition, a relatively high share of deposits is covered by deposit guarantee schemes (Chapter 3.1).

While unrealised losses on bond holdings are relatively limited, interlinkages with the NBFI sector could challenge euro area banks

Panel b: small banks refer to banks with total assets of up to €100 billion, medium-sized banks from €100 billion to €500 billion, and large banks over €500 billion. The dashed lines represent intra-group weighted averages.
A greater need to respond to cyber and climate risks, and strong interlinkages with the NBFI sector, may also challenge euro area banks. Next to the cyclical headwinds associated with the challenging macro-financial conditions, euro area banks need to press ahead with digital transformation, not least so they can respond to the growing threat of cyber risks (Section 3.3). They also need to manage the implications of the transition to a greener economy. The results of the second ECB top-down economy-wide climate stress test suggest that, while the overall impact of the green transition is limited relative to portfolio size, it increases banks’ expected losses and provision needs in the short term (Box A in Special Feature C). In addition, elevated vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector may produce spillover risks for euro area banks, given the strong interconnections, exposing such banks to liquidity, asset price and credit risks (Special Feature B). These links appear on both sides of banks’ balance sheets and are stronger for larger banks (Chart 8, panel b).
Completion of the banking union would further enhance the resilience of the financial system
All in all, the financial stability outlook remains fragile, with stresses in the United States and Switzerland bringing banking sector vulnerabilities back into focus in an uncertain macro-financial environment. Pre-existing vulnerabilities could become more prominent and risks could spread across different sectors, should further pockets of vulnerability be revealed in the US or other banking sectors and/or macro-financial conditions worsen. The materialisation of downside risks to economic growth, more persistent inflation or a disorderly tightening of financial conditions could expose existing vulnerabilities, notably those associated with high levels of debt across the economy as well as the potential for disorderly adjustments in both financial and tangible asset markets. At the same time, shocks such as the failure to reach a political agreement on the US government debt ceiling or a further escalation of geopolitical tensions could cause these vulnerabilities to materialise, possibly simultaneously.
Preserving financial sector resilience remains key as the financial cycle turns. In the light of elevated uncertainty, involving accumulated vulnerabilities and signs of a turning financial cycle, macroprudential policy should continue to focus on ensuring that the financial system remains able to withstand adverse shocks. Existing macroprudential capital buffers should therefore be maintained to preserve the resilience of the banking sector, as the conditions for their release have not yet been met. Targeted increases in capital buffer requirements may still be considered in some countries. For example, in countries with a framework that features a positive neutral rate for the countercyclical capital buffer, the build-up of the buffer towards the neutral rate is welcome, provided that procyclical effects are avoided. Banks should, in the context of increased downside risks to economic growth and recent banking sector stresses, refrain from increasing payout ratios further, but should instead focus on preserving their existing substantial resilience. Finally, borrower-based measures under the remit of national authorities should continue to ensure sound lending standards and the sustainability of household debt, in a framework where capital-based and borrower-based measures complement each other.
The sources of US and Swiss banking sector stress have highlighted the need to complete the banking union and to further strengthen the EU bank regulatory framework. The recent banking sector stress has highlighted the need for sound corporate governance and effective risk control by banks. At the same time, it has also been a powerful reminder of the need to complete the banking union (Section 5.1), in particular the crisis management framework and a common European deposit insurance scheme. In addition, full implementation of the final Basel III elements by the agreed deadline of January 2025 is essential to ensure that banks remain well-capitalised, in order to foster trust in the EU banking system and to provide additional levers for supervisory scrutiny. ECB Banking Supervision, the Single Resolution Board and the European Banking Authority have recently reiterated the need for the consistent application of the EU’s detailed order according to which shareholders and creditors of a troubled bank should bear losses applied in past cases. This will also guide the actions of the Single Resolution Board and ECB Banking Supervision in any possible crisis interventions going forward.
Structural vulnerabilities in different parts of the non-bank financial sector require a comprehensive policy response across entities and activities. In the light of persisting vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector and the risk of renewed stress, it is critical that policy initiatives continue to be pursued as a matter of priority. The focus should be on policies that reduce liquidity mismatch in investment funds, tackle risks arising from financial and synthetic leverage across the NBFI sector and enhance liquidity preparedness across a broad range of institutions, especially in relation to margin calls. As it will take time for regulatory reforms to be agreed internationally and then implemented, the authorities regulating and supervising NBFI entities should pay close attention to vulnerabilities in the sector and should play an active role in strengthening resilience, in accordance with their mandates and existing policy frameworks (Section 5.2).
1 Macro-financial and credit environment
1.1 An improved but still fragile economic outlook
Amid high uncertainty, private sector forecasters have upgraded their baseline growth expectations for the euro area in the light of moderating energy prices. The global economic outlook seems fragile, after a period of high macro volatility, as geopolitical tensions remain high and financial conditions are tightening. At the same time, forecasters have revised euro area growth expectations for 2023 up to 0.6%, in contrast to expectations of a shallow recession of -0.1% as recently as November last year, in response to falling energy prices, China’s reopening helping to ease strains on global supply chains and labour markets remaining tight. In parallel, consensus inflation expectations for 2023 remain high (5.6% as against 5.8% in November 2022). Despite the improvement in growth prospects, risks to the outlook for economic growth remain elevated, as the distribution of expected GDP outcomes for the euro area economy in 2023 remains tilted to the downside (Chart 1.1, panel a) and inflation expectations remain high (Chart 1.1, panel b). Against the background of the stress events in the banking sector, risks to the outlook are driven predominantly by the potential for a disorderly tightening of financial conditions combined with heightened geopolitical risks.

Easing energy prices have helped headline inflation to moderate, but risks to energy prices and inflation remain tilted to the upside. Despite a normalisation of energy prices, underlying global price inflation remains elevated and upside risks to commodity prices remain high. Tight and resilient labour markets have contributed to persistent core inflationary pressures. Moreover, measures of core inflation have continued to surprise to the upside, as the pass-through of higher costs to the services, food and industrial goods sectors is still ongoing and is likely incomplete. High geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with efforts to secure natural gas supply for the next winter season (Chapter 2) and a stronger than expected economic rebound in China, could push energy prices higher again.

The global growth outlook could be derailed if there is a disorderly tightening of financial conditions while inflation remains at high levels. To ensure the timely return of inflation to their medium-term targets, central banks around the world have continued to raise their policy rates, thereby contributing to a global tightening of financial conditions. Consequently, the market pricing of the terminal rate globally, and in the euro area, has increased (Chart 1.2, panel a). Adding to tighter conditions, the recent failures of a number of US regional banks and the takeover of a Swiss bank have pushed up risk premia, including in the euro area (Chart 1.2, panel b). Moreover, changes in monetary policy expectations have resulted in the euro appreciating against a bucket of major currencies, further contributing to tighter financial conditions. Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten credit conditions more strongly than expected, with feedback to the broader economy, as they might impact credit availability and increase debt service costs further.

Globally, the failure to raise the US debt ceiling, possible side effects of China’s reopening and vulnerabilities in emerging markets are adding to downside risk and heightened uncertainty. Against the background of high political uncertainty, the inability to raise the US debt ceiling debate could spark financial market volatility and hit US growth prospects. A disorderly process could add to the risks of US sovereign debt being downgraded (Chapter 2).
[

]
Moreover, the reopening of the Chinese economy after pandemic lockdowns is having an ambiguous impact on global inflation levels and is adding further to uncertainty. On the one hand, it could exert upward pressure on commodity prices and global inflation levels as pent-up demand boosts consumer expenditure. On the other hand, the reopening is helping to ease supply bottlenecks.
[
3
]
Moreover, risks in China’s property market remain high, even though some improvement in conditions has been observed since the start of the year. Finally, a prudent policy stance in emerging markets is currently helping to mitigate spillovers from higher interest rates in developed economies and has kept vulnerabilities contained.
[

]
However, a further – or disorderly – tightening of financial conditions could leave some emerging market economies vulnerable to capital outflows and might challenge their ability to service foreign currency debt.
Against the background of high uncertainty, the risks to financial stability stemming from materialising vulnerabilities remain elevated. The drop in energy prices has relieved some pressure on inflation and has contributed to an improvement in the growth outlook. However, inflation remains high and the outlook for economic growth remains weak, with risks skewed to the downside. Moreover, after an episode of high macro volatility, global economies face renewed uncertainty from the potential financial feedback to credit availability resulting from the recent stress events in the banking sectors of some mature economies.
1.2 Fiscal positions benefit from lower energy prices, while unaddressed challenges lie ahead
The euro area fiscal deficit is expected to decline, as lower energy prices help the fiscal outlook. The projected euro area budget deficit is expected to decline somewhat in 2023 (to 3.4% of GDP) and more significantly in 2024 (to 2.4% of GDP), before remaining unchanged in 2025 (Chart 1.3, panel a). The forecast for the euro area fiscal position is driven by the expected improvement in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, followed by an improvement in the cyclical component, while interest payments are expected to gradually increase as maturing public debt is rolled over at higher interest rates. There are significant downside risks to this outlook, however, as fiscal positions ultimately depend on inflation developments and economic uncertainty going forward. Consequently, the improvement in fiscal positions since the previous version of the Financial Stability Review will be susceptible to substantial downward revisions if risks materialise in the form of higher energy prices (Chapter 2), Next Generation EU (NGEU) absorption rates are lower than expected or the inflation outlook deteriorates significantly.
Fiscal support measures to cushion the energy price shock remain largely untargeted. Since the end of 2022, favourable energy price and inflation developments have contributed to a slight downward rescaling of fiscal support measures to about 1.8% of GDP from over 1.9% of GDP at the end of 2022.
[
5
]
At the same time, fiscal support has been revised up for some euro area countries since the previous issue of the Financial Stability Review, following the extension of measures into 2023 or updated estimates based on final budget laws. While these support measures are helping to cushion the impact of high inflation in the short term, the effect is expected to reverse in the years after 2023. Additionally, most fiscal support measures remain untargeted and are at odds with the monetary policy response to fight inflation (Chart 1.3, panel b).
[
6
]
Broad-based fiscal stimulus to aggregate demand is unwarranted and economically inefficient; this should preferably be replaced by policies that target only vulnerable cohorts of corporates and households.

Panel b: monetary impulse reflects the expected change in short-term interest rates as implied by the OIS (€STR) forward curve at the end of each calendar year. The impulse does not include the impact of unconventional monetary policy measures.
A favourable snowball effect, amid high inflation, has initially helped to push government debt-to-GDP ratios onto a declining trajectory. In a baseline scenario, the euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 89.4% of GDP in 2023 to slightly below 87% in 2025. Nevertheless, the ratio is projected to remain above pre-pandemic levels (84%) through 2025. The expected decline is driven mainly by a favourable interest rate-growth differential (the snowball effect) stemming from high nominal GDP growth, which should more than offset foreseen refinancing needs arising from persisting, albeit decreasing, primary deficits.
[

]
Additionally, sovereign debt ratios have benefited from a declining real debt burden owing to first-round effects (a favourable denominator effect).
[
8
]
In the longer term, euro area public finances would likely be negatively affected by persistently high inflation. High inflation would have an adverse impact on fiscal positions through rising interest rates that would gradually propagate to interest payments. Additionally, the detrimental impact of the energy price shock on real economic activity will have a negative effect on fiscal positions. The size of this negative effect can primarily be explained by the nature and size of the inflation shock in the euro area – mainly a large, external shock that negatively affects household balance sheets, corporate profitability and growth, and puts high pressure on nominal public spending.
[

]
Although sovereign debt service risks have been kept in check by benign debt service conditions, they might become more challenging in the future. At present, several factors are helping debt serviceability in the short term. First, the lengthening maturity of the outstanding debt stock means that principal repayment needs are about 15% lower than they would have been for running the same amount of debt against the maturity profile in 2010. Second, although yields have been increasing, the average interest paid on outstanding government debt is still hovering around record lows for most euro area sovereigns (1.7% in March 2023), and sovereigns have continued issuing longer-term debt – despite the steep increase in funding costs. Third, higher interest payments and debt issuance have not offset nominal GDP growth, a situation which has contributed to declining debt service ratios (Chart 1.4, panel a). However, debt service ratios in some euro area countries remain high, at around 40% of GDP, and rollover risks have increased as interest rate uncertainty has added to high price volatility in sovereign bond markets (Chapter 2). A further tightening of financial conditions could spark an increase in borrowing costs for more-indebted sovereigns. This means that funding conditions could become more challenging, particularly when sovereigns need to issue high volumes of debt in volatile and shallow government bond markets.
As central bank balance sheets are reduced around the world, fiscal issuance will be increasingly absorbed by the private sector. The envisaged balance sheet run-off will reduce the market footprint of the Eurosystem, thus fostering the efficient transmission of monetary policy.
[
10
]
At the same time, the higher expected net issuance of sovereign debt this year on top of the higher free float resulting from the balance sheet run-off will need to be absorbed by the private sector.
[
11
]
This could include foreign investors, which might have a stabilising impact (Box 3), and non-banks, but also encompasses domestic banking sectors. Against this background, stress in the euro area banking sector might renew concerns over the sovereign-bank nexus. So far, the co-movement in sovereign and bank credit risk has been much more contained than in previous joint stress periods (Chart 1.4, panel b).

Panel b: the chart displays the average five-year CDS spreads across euro area banks and sovereigns in basis points. Pre/post failure reflects the period before/after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Credit Suisse as of 10 March 2023.
Short-term fiscal pressures remain contained, but medium-term challenges are adding to financial stability risks. Medium and longer-term challenges are adding to sovereign vulnerabilities. Climate change is a significant source of sovereign risk (Special Feature C), and an ageing population aggravates challenges around pensions and longer-term economic growth prospects. At the current juncture, the recent stress episode in the banking sectors of some mature economies remains contained, but credit risk spillovers between sovereign and banks could lead to a reassessment of sovereign risk by market participants. The outlook for sovereigns may deteriorate if financial conditions tighten, geopolitical tensions contribute to higher commodity prices, market liquidity is low, refinancing needs are high and additional fiscal support is needed.
1.3 Corporates bank on high margins, but vulnerabilities might increase as financial conditions tighten
Euro area firms have benefited from a sharp post-pandemic recovery and strong profits, but business prospects are surrounded by high uncertainty. Aggregate corporate vulnerabilities remained below their long-run average for much of last year, with nominal gross profits surprisingly strong (19% above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of 2022). Despite the overall tightening of financial conditions, lower indebtedness and a high interest coverage ratio kept corporate vulnerabilities below their long-term average (Chart 1.5, panel a). Furthermore, both higher revenues and stronger profit margins contributed significantly to the corporate recovery in the second half of 2022 (Chart 1.5, panel b). These high profit margins are closely linked to high inflation prints in the euro area, as around half of the gross value-added deflator is explained by higher profit margins.

*) For more detail on the indicator components, see the box entitled “Assessing corporate vulnerabilities in the euro area”, Financial Stability Review, ECB, November 2020.
Aggregate corporate vulnerabilities are expected to increase by less than previously anticipated, but a disorderly tightening of credit conditions is a key risk. Revisions in the forecast of the corporate vulnerability indicator since the previous edition of the Financial Stability Review mainly reflect the baseline scenario of an improving economic environment and moderating debt accumulation. At the same time, high downside risks to the economic outlook are also translating into uncertain prospects for corporates, and not all corporates have benefited equally from the economic recovery. Moreover, a disorderly tightening of financial conditions resulting from the recent stress episode in the global banking sector remains a key risk for business prospects.
Despite the overall resilience of the corporate sector, corporate fragilities vary greatly across sectors and firm sizes. Valuations of firms with higher capital expenditure needs are more sensitive to changes in interest rates (Chart 1.6, panel a). Some of these firms might also be more vulnerable to rising borrowing costs and generally have lower interest coverage ratios (Box 1). Additionally, survey-based confidence measures indicate a large dispersion across different sectors in the euro area (Chart 1.6, panel b). In general, lower business confidence has been observed in energy-intensive sectors, while sectors that have benefited more from the post-pandemic reopening demonstrate greater confidence. Moreover, soft data from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) indicate that SMEs have benefited less from the rebound in economic activity.

Panel b: standard deviation across 56 NACE Rev. 2 sectors in the euro area.
Tighter financing conditions have started to have an impact on firms’ debt service costs and issuance behaviour. As financial conditions have tightened, both markets and banks have reassessed the risks surrounding corporate activity. Consequently, the cost of debt has increased sharply since mid-2022 (Chart 1.7, panel a).
[
13
]
Net lending flows fell back strongly in the first months of 2023 as it became more expensive to roll over debt, indicating deleveraging in some countries and sectors. In 2022 higher interest rates and higher working capital needs on account of high production costs also contributed to a shift from long-term lending to loans with a shorter maturity. The results of the ECB’s Q1 2023 bank lending survey indicate that the rise in the general level of interest rates, together with a decline in fixed investments, served to dampen demand for new lending. Furthermore, the impact of tighter credit standards might build up over time, with a delayed pass-through to the real activity of firms. In some euro area countries, high debt service needs are accompanied by lower interest coverage ratios, and corporates might be impacted more by the rising rate environment.
At the same time, corporate balance sheets in most euro area countries are currently healthier than they were during previous rate-hiking cycles. A long period of low interest rates and a strong post-pandemic recovery have helped the average corporate to build resilience in the face of a new downturn and rapidly rising financing costs. Gross interest coverage ratios have improved, particularly for countries which started with lower levels of interest coverage in the non-financial corporate sector (Chart 1.7, panel b). Moreover, non-financial corporate debt levels declined to 144% of gross value added in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with 148% before the pandemic.

Bankruptcies in some euro area countries have started to increase from a very low base, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Bankruptcies in most large euro area economies remain below pre-pandemic averages, although they have now started to normalise from the low levels reached during the pandemic.
[

]
Moreover, forward-looking measures for default risk signal elevated risk (Chart 1.7, panel c), driven by those sectors directly impacted by the energy crisis such as transport and industry.
Corporate vulnerabilities might be higher than the aggregate suggests, as not every corporate benefited equally from the post-pandemic recovery. The uneven impact of two succeeding, and distinctly different, crises has introduced considerable diversity over the cross-section of firms and might imply that an economic recession could have more severe consequences for financial stability than this aggregate picture suggests. Furthermore, the predominance of variable-rate lending in some countries, together with high corporate debt levels by historical and international standards, renders some corporates vulnerable to a further or disorderly tightening of financial conditions. Moreover, debt instruments that are more sensitive to rate increases, such as leveraged loans, might be particularly exposed should financial conditions tighten further. As such, there could be more defaults going forward, with potential knock-on effects on bank balance sheets and household employment prospects.

Corporate vulnerabilities and the risks of lower growth and higher rates
Prepared by Nander de Vette, Stephan Fahr, Pablo Serrano Ascandoni and Peter Welz
Following a strong post-pandemic recovery in profits, euro area non-financial corporations are now facing the risk of stagnating economic activity combined with tightening financial conditions. As monetary policy normalises, interest rates on corporate bonds and loans are increasing at their fastest pace in decades, leading to declining corporate lending and investment. Against this backdrop, this box uses firm-level balance sheet data to identify vulnerable non-financial corporations (NFCs) based on the Altman Z-score, a measure of insolvency risk.

1.4 A resilient household sector is facing tightening financial conditions
Euro area households have benefited from the improvement in economic conditions, despite elevated uncertainty and the impact of persistent inflation. While households remain worried about their future economic situation, consumer sentiment improved somewhat as energy prices started to decline at the end of 2022. This helped to ease upward pressure on headline inflation and make it more likely that a recession would be avoided in 2023 (Chart 1.8, panel a). Nevertheless, stubbornly high inflation continues to weigh on households’ real disposable incomes. This led to a decline in real household consumption in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 1.8, panel b).
Strong labour markets have provided constant support to household resilience. The unemployment rate in the euro area remained at historic lows of around 6.6% throughout the end of 2022 and start of 2023, while the job vacancy rate reached an all-time high of over 3% (Chart 1.8, panel c). This situation benefits household incomes and suggests that a significant reduction in labour demand would be needed to cause a large increase in unemployment.

Non-durable goods consumption refers to the consumption of goods that can be used only once or that have a lifetime of considerably less than one year (including energy and food). Panel c: the latest data for the job vacancy rate refer to Q4 2022.
Tightening financial conditions have led to a turn in household borrowing, particularly for interest rate-sensitive items. Interest rates on household loans increased to 4% in March 2023, up by 2 percentage points year on year and marking the fastest increase since the euro was introduced. This resulted in a marked deceleration to 2.8% in the annual growth of lending to households, down by over 1.5 percentage points over the same period, driven predominantly by a contraction in demand for new mortgage loans (Section 1.5). While the annual growth in loan volumes has remained positive, net loan flows have turned negative in some euro area countries since the end of 2022, meaning that more loans were repaid than new loans were issued (Chart 1.9, panel a). As interest rates rise and banks signal their intention to continue tightening credit standards, lending volumes are likely to decline further – possibly resulting in a deleveraging of the household sector.
The debt servicing capacity of some households may be challenged by tightening financial conditions. Households in many countries continue to be shielded from immediate increases in the interest burden on their outstanding debt as a high share of loans have been issued with longer interest rate fixation periods over the last decade. This trend has reversed somewhat since the second half of 2022, particularly in countries where the relative pricing of variable-rate and fixed-rate loans has changed. Households in these countries are therefore more exposed to a repricing of outstanding debt over the short term. Some households may fall into distress as the purchasing power of their incomes continues to decline and credit standards are, as expected, tightened further. At the current juncture, households at the lower end of the income distribution are the most vulnerable as they are disproportionally affected by high inflation. Wider risks to financial stability appear contained, however, as households in some countries have experienced a significant deleveraging since the global financial crisis across the income distribution and, in particular, in the lowest income cohorts. Moreover, these households account for only a small share of overall household borrowing (Chart 1.9, panel b).

Panel b: shares of loans held by income quintiles are forward-extrapolated from the ECB’s 2017 Household Finance and Consumption Survey and are multiplied by outstanding loans.
While vulnerabilities among households have increased further, risks still appear moderate. Although net wealth growth has moderated significantly, aggregate household balance sheets remain resilient and may benefit from deleveraging going forward. Households’ real incomes and consumption, while under pressure from persistently elevated inflation, are supported by the continued strength of labour markets and fiscal measures. Nonetheless, some vulnerable households may face difficulties servicing their debt, as reflected in an increase in consumer loans classified by banks as suffering a significant deterioration in credit quality (Chapter 3). Such vulnerabilities could worsen, in particular if labour market conditions deteriorate or energy prices rise again significantly. Moreover, housing markets have started to cool in most euro area countries, and price developments could weigh on consumer sentiment going forward (Section 1.5). In the medium term, vulnerabilities could be exposed and debt servicing capacity could deteriorate, especially in countries where residential properties remain overvalued, debt levels are elevated and household debt is mainly at variable rates. That said, such an adverse scenario currently remains a tail risk.
1.5 Vulnerable real estate markets are turning
Both mortgage loan origination and house prices have slowed significantly amid higher interest rates. The average interest rate on loans for house purchase in the euro area stood at 3.4% in March 2023, almost 2 percentage points higher than it had been a year earlier. This steep rise in borrowing costs has led to a significant decline in loan origination. While the volume of new lending was higher during the first half of 2022 than in previous years, it declined markedly in the second half of the year and fell again sharply at the beginning of 2023 (Chart 1.10, panel a). Residential real estate (RRE) prices in some euro area countries or market segments also started declining in the second half of 2022. This fall could become more pronounced as higher interest rates reduce mortgage affordability (Chart 1.10, panel b). In the ECB’s latest bank lending survey, banks reported a further substantial net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and a strong net decline in loan demand in the first quarter of 2023. They expect credit standards for mortgages to tighten further, and net loan demand to decline further, in the second quarter of the year as well, although to a lesser extent than during the first quarter. In other words, the trends observed in new lending and house prices at the end of 2022 are expected to continue in 2023.
A combination of stretched valuations, high debt and interest rate sensitivity in some euro area countries could amplify system-wide losses should an adverse scenario materialise. The rapid growth in RRE prices over the last few years has led to stretched valuations in some euro area countries, as house price dynamics have exceeded their fundamentals. In some euro area countries, the estimates of house price overvaluation in the fourth quarter of 2022 exceed 10%, increasing the risk of a price correction. At the same time, household indebtedness has remained high, increasing the risk of defaults or lower consumption in the event of adverse shocks, such as a signifi"

Card fraud in 2021 falls to lowest level since start of data collection
12% decline in card-not-present fraud after introduction of strong customer authentication
63% of total value of card fraud involves cross-border transactions
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its card fraud report, which is based on information provided by 20 card payment scheme operators. Card fraud in 2021 continued its downward trend, falling to its lowest level since data collection began. It constituted 0.028% of the total value of card payments made using cards issued in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), amounting to €1.53 billion from a total value of €5.40 trillion. By comparison, card fraud in 2019 amounted to €1.87 billion from a total value of €5.16 trillion. The highest share of card fraud observed to date was 0.048% in 2008.
There are two distinct types of card fraud: (1) card-not-present fraud, i.e. fraud conducted remotely in online and telephone payments, using card details obtained by scams such as phishing; and (2) card-present fraud, which typically occurs at retail outlets and ATMs and involves the use of counterfeit cards.
Card-not-present fraud, which accounted for approximately 84% of the total value of card fraud in 2021, declined by 12% from 2020 following the market-wide implementation of strong customer authentication under the revised EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Card-present fraud fell by 6% in 2021 from its 2020 level, owing to the continued global roll-out of industry standards, which have been effective in reducing opportunities to commit magnetic stripe counterfeit fraud.
As in previous reports, most of the card fraud in both 2020 and 2021 involved cross-border transactions. Although cross-border transactions only accounted for 11% of the total value of card payment transactions, they accounted for 63% of the total value of card fraud in 2021.

This report presents some general developments relating to card fraud in 2020 and 2021, in aggregated form without mentioning specific countries. Unless stated otherwise, the results presented are generally derived from “an issuing perspective”, which refers to payments made with cards issued within SEPA and acquired worldwide. As with previous analyses of the collected data, a few methodological issues continue to apply; these are detailed in the annex. Since these issues are limited to a few specific schemes and countries, they have been accepted for the present analysis.
2 Level of card fraud
The total value of transactions using cards issued in SEPA amounted to €5.40 trillion in 2021, of which €1.53 billion (0.028%) was fraudulent (see Chart 1a).
After both the value of overall card payments and the value of card fraud had shown similar year-on-year declines in 2020 amid the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (-6.9% and -7.7% respectively), this similarity ceased in 2021. The value of overall card payments recovered in 2021, increasing sharply compared with 2020 (+12.3%).
Meanwhile, the value of card fraud continued its steep decline in 2021, dropping by 11.2% compared with the previous year. Consequently, fraud as a share of the total value of transactions declined notably in 2021 to 0.028% (from 0.036% in 2020). This marked the lowest fraud share recorded since the start of data collection in 2008. For cards issued in the euro area, the value of fraud as a share of total card transactions in 2020 and 2021 remained below the respective share for cards issued in SEPA as a whole, at 0.034% and 0.026% respectively.
The total number of fraudulent card transactions declined in 2021 to 23.85 million (-7%), after having steadily increased in previous years (see Chart 1b).

In relative terms, card fraud volumes as a share of the total number of card payments decreased from 0.026% in 2020 to 0.021% in 2021. Overall, fraud shares in terms of volumes continued to remain considerably below the corresponding figures for values in both 2020 and 2021.

3 Developments in card-not-present and card-present fraud
Card fraud in 2021 declined in terms of both card-present transactions (at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals) and card-not-present (CNP) transactions (e.g. via the internet).
As in previous years, the vast majority of card fraud related to CNP transactions (see charts 1a and 1b). In both 2020 and 2021, CNP fraud accounted for approximately 84% of the total value of card fraud. This share had been growing steadily until 2020, in line with the continuously increasing importance of e-commerce and the use of card payments over the internet. The higher share also reflects the effectiveness of various fraud prevention measures in reducing card-present fraud at POS terminals and ATMs.
In 2021 the total value of CNP fraud amounted to €1.28 billion (see Chart 2), showing a strong decline compared with 2020 (-12.1%). The majority of CNP fraud continued to take place across borders (i.e. the transaction was acquired in a country other than the country where the card was issued), with the largest share relating to cross-border transactions within SEPA. The overall decline in the total value of CNP fraud was driven by a notable decrease in fraud among transactions acquired within SEPA (domestic and cross-border transactions combined). The value of fraudulent CNP transactions acquired outside SEPA increased in 2021.
The strong decline in CNP fraud for transactions acquired within SEPA in 2021 points to a beneficial impact of the Regulatory Technical Standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication (hereafter “RTS for SCA and CSC”) under the revised EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

The market-wide implementation of these enhanced security standards by payment service providers ahead of 31 December 2020 seems to have notably increased the security of CNP transactions.

Value of CNP fraud by geographical breakdown
(total value of CNP fraud in EUR millions)

Card-present fraud committed at ATMs and POS terminals continued to decline in 2021 (-6.4%), following a decrease of 27.7% in the previous year. The value of ATM fraud amounted to around €74 million in 2021 (-4.3% compared with 2020); the value of card fraud at POS terminals amounted to €177 million (-7.2%; see Chart 3).
The decrease in the value of ATM fraud in 2021 was driven by a further strong decline in counterfeit card fraud (-67.3%), which only accounted for 3% of total ATM fraud. Similarly, the overall decline in card-present fraud at POS terminals in 2021 was due to a 38.9% reduction in counterfeit card fraud, while other types of fraud in card-present transactions increased in value and should be monitored closely in the coming years. This shows that the increased global roll-out and maturity of EMV terminals has been effective in reducing opportunities for committing magnetic stripe counterfeit fraud. Consequently, occurrences of fraud using counterfeit cards seem to be becoming less common, particularly with regard to ATM cash withdrawals.
Losses from lost or stolen cards continued to be the main type of card-present fraud, accounting for 88% of all ATM and 56% of all POS fraud in 2021. Only a minor share of card fraud conducted at ATMs was due to other types of card-present fraud, while these continued to play a more significant role at POS terminals.

4 The geographical breakdown of card fraud
The majority of card fraud in both 2020 and 2021 continued to involve cross-border transactions. While cross-border card transactions represented 11% of the overall value of card payments in 2021, they accounted for 63% of the value of card fraud (see charts 4a and 4b).
In the years leading up to 2020, cross-border transactions both within and outside SEPA grew at a faster pace than domestic card payments, indicating that cardholders increasingly purchase goods and services across borders at physical or e-commerce merchants, as well as an increase in the cross-border issuing of cards. In 2020 the share of cross-border transactions in the overall value of card payments declined slightly, as they appeared to be more heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 the value of card payments increased again across all geographical categories, with particularly strong growth in cross-border transactions acquired within both SEPA (+25.5%) and non-SEPA countries (+21.6%).
Chart 4
Value of card payment transactions and fraud by geographical dimension

Turning to the geographical breakdown for card fraud, the total value of domestic and cross-border fraud for transactions acquired within SEPA declined by 9% and 16% respectively in 2021 (compared with a decline of around 4% in both cases in 2020). Meanwhile, the value of fraud for transactions acquired outside SEPA increased by 6% in 2021, following a decline of around 30% in 2020. However, this increase was more than outweighed by the aforementioned general uptake in cross-border payments acquired outside SEPA. Consequently, relative fraud shares declined across all geographical dimensions in 2021.
The total value of fraud by issuing country declined in 2021 for 20 EU Member States, while increases for the remaining 7 Member States were minor. In relative terms, fraud shares in terms of value declined across 26 Member States. For the one remaining Member State, fraud as a share of the total value of card payments remained roughly unchanged between 2020 and 2021 and was already at a relatively low level (0.009%).
5 Outlook
The overall outlook for card fraud in Europe appears to have further improved. The market-wide implementation of the RTS for SCA and CSC appears to have strongly reduced the occurrence of card fraud in 2021, both in absolute and relative terms. A steep decline is registered in CNP fraud, due to the widespread adoption of the 3D Secure standard to support strong customer authentication, as required by the RTS for SCA and CSC. In addition, the global implementation of the EMV standard continued to reduce opportunities for card-present fraud using counterfeit cards.
Nevertheless, industry, regulators and consumers need to remain vigilant. 2020 and 2021 were exceptional years, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures (e.g. lockdowns) having a notable impact on both card payments and fraud; among other factors, both international travel and the cross-border use of cards were limited by the pandemic. Furthermore, the aforementioned success of both industry and regulatory measures in reducing card fraud may shift the attention of fraudsters towards card holders, potentially further increasing fraud through social engineering (e.g. by manipulation of the payer) or the theft of physical cards.
Future analysis of newly available data – due to the recent change in the reporting framework – might provide an even clearer picture of emerging issues and offer further insights into the impact of the current implementation of PSD2-related measures.
ANNEX: Methodological considerations
Two methodological data issues already identified in previous analyses continue to apply, namely that some card payment scheme operators (i) allocate transactions with cards issued cross-border to the country of issuance as opposed to the location of the issuer, and (ii) allocate CNP transactions acquired cross-border by location of the acquirer instead of by location of the merchant. These divergences result in inconsistencies between data collected from the card payment schemes and similar data reported by payment service providers for ECB Statistical Data Warehouse purposes.
In addition, some adjustments have been made to data reported to avoid double counting domestic transactions where cards are co-badged. For a few countries, such as France, these adjustments may result in the under-reporting of total transactions and thus give a slightly over-estimated fraud rate.
Given that these inconsistencies are limited to a few specific schemes and countries, they have been accepted for this analysis.

Compared with February 2023:
consumer inflation expectations increased significantly;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months were broadly stable, while expectations for nominal spending growth rose further;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became slightly more negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time increased;
consumers’ expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months increased to 9.9% in March 2023, from 8.7% in February. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months increased, moving from 4.6% in February to 5.0%. Expectations for inflation three years ahead also increased, from 2.4% to 2.9%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the three years horizon. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead reached its highest level since the start of the survey in April 2020. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to increase by 1.3% over the next 12 months, up from 1.2% in February. Expected nominal income growth declined for older consumers (aged 55 and above), while it increased for younger consumers (aged 18-34). Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months rose to 7.1%, from 6.6% in February. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months increased to 4.1%, from 3.9% in February. The developments in perceptions and expectations about nominal spending remained largely aligned across income and age groups. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined slightly to -1.0%, from -0.9% in February. In line with these lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead increased to 11.7%, compared with 11.5% in February. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.3%). The lowest income quintile reported the highest expected and perceived unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected the price of their home over the next 12 months to increase by 2.7%. While somewhat higher than in previous months, home price growth expectations remained well below those recorded in the first half of 2022. This increase mainly reflected higher expectations of respondents with below-median incomes and of younger respondents (aged 18-34). Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to edge up to 5.1%, standing 1.8 percentage points above the expectations recorded at the start of 2022. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both tightened compared with February. (Housing and credit access results)

HICP inflation expectations revised down for 2023; counterbalancing revisions for 2024 (down) and 2025 (up); longer-term expectations unchanged
Real GDP growth expectations revised up for 2023, but down slightly for 2024 and 2025
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for 2023-25
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2023, respondents’ expectations for headline HICP inflation in 2023 were revised down compared with the previous survey round, while their expectations for HICP inflation excluding food and energy in 2023 were revised up. The downward revision of headline inflation expectations primarily reflects lower expected energy price inflation (particularly for natural gas), while the upward revision for HICP inflation excluding food and energy mainly reflects recent data outturns, as well as higher wage growth forecasts. Headline inflation expectations for 2023, 2024 and 2025 now stand at 5.6%, 2.6% and 2.2% respectively, while longer-term inflation expectations (which relate to 2027) remain unchanged at 2.1%.
Expectations for real GDP growth were revised up for 2023, but down slightly for 2024 and 2025. The upward revision for 2023 primarily reflects a carry-over from stronger than expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the downward revisions for 2024 and 2025 mainly reflect the tightening of financial conditions. Longer-term expectations remained unchanged at 1.4%.
Expected unemployment rates were revised down by 0.1-0.2 percentage points for the period 2023-25. The unemployment rate is now expected to rise to 6.8% in 2023 (having stood at 6.6% in February 2023) and remain at that level in 2024, before declining gradually to stand at 6.5% in 2027."

The inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing high inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that the Governing Council formed at its previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, the past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.
The Governing Council’s future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions will continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The key ECB interest rates remain the Governing Council’s primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. In parallel, the Governing Council will keep reducing the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio at a measured and predictable pace. In line with these principles, the Governing Council expects to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 3.75%, 4.00% and 3.25% respectively, with effect from 10 May 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem does not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023. The Governing Council expects to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. The ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."
,"Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 3-4 May 2023
1 June 2023
1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel noted that since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, the market narrative had shifted back from financial stability concerns to inflation concerns and to potential effects on the economy from the turbulence in the banking sector. Markets seemed so far to have digested the bank failures well, especially in the euro area. Measures of systemic stress, volatility and market liquidity had returned to close to their levels before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Risk assets in the euro area had not only largely recovered the losses experienced following the SVB failure, but in some cases had even rallied to new multi-year highs. Sovereign bond spreads had also shown remarkable resilience. Yet investors had significantly scaled back expectations of ECB monetary policy tightening. While the sharp downward shift in expectations for monetary policy rates at the height of the banking tensions had been partially reversed, the peak rate expected for the deposit facility remained around 50 basis points below levels priced in before the failure of SVB. Three potential factors could explain this repricing: receding inflation risks, heightened recession fears in the face of tighter financial conditions, or financial stability concerns. However, none of these explanations was fully borne out by financial market data.
On the basis of market pricing, current risks of systemic stress seemed contained. Implied volatility in US bond markets had retreated to its 2022 average from very high levels in mid-March, while stock market implied volatility in the United States had recently fallen to its lowest level since November 2021. Similarly, liquidity conditions in euro area sovereign bond markets had normalised.
The turbulence had left a lasting mark on bank stock indices, which remained below the levels observed before SVB’s failure. However, euro area bank stocks currently stood above their level at the start of 2023, and spillovers from the financial sector to the non-financial corporate sector had been limited. Prices for risk assets had generally been less adversely affected in the euro area than in the United States.
The general resilience of financial markets also extended to sovereign bonds. Sovereign spreads had widened only slightly after the SVB failure, had normalised quickly after the banking tensions had subsided and had since remained close to their pre-SVB levels. This resilience had not been challenged by evolving market expectations for the reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio. Both the start of quantitative tightening and expectations of a full roll-off had been absorbed smoothly by the market.
Despite fading concerns about market turbulence, investors had, in response to the banking tensions, significantly scaled back expectations for future ECB interest rate hikes.
A first possible explanation for the pronounced repricing of expectations for ECB interest rates could be receding concerns about inflation risks in the euro area. The decline in inflation-linked swap (ILS) forward rates, which had started at the beginning of March, had continued with the onset of the banking turbulence, in line with an initially disinflationary effect from the turbulence. At the same time, market participants did not seem to see the risks to the longer-term inflation outlook as having been alleviated by the banking tensions. The five-year forward ILS rate five years ahead had remained stubbornly above 2.4% since the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting. Investors continued to consider a scenario where inflation remained above target over the longer term significantly more probable than a scenario where it dropped below 2%.
An alternative explanation for the repricing of monetary policy expectations was the perception that tighter financial conditions made a recession more likely, implying less need for further rate hikes. However, most common financial conditions indices for the euro area had remained broadly unchanged since the collapse of SVB, even though bank lending rates had been increasing. There was also little indication in financial markets that the banking sector stress had affected economic growth. Investors were currently pricing in only marginally higher tail risks to the economic outlook for the euro area compared with the pre-SVB period.
The evolution of the exchange rate provided further insights into the expected impact of the banking sector turbulence on the economy. Since the start of the banking tensions the euro had appreciated discernibly against the US dollar, in line with the narrowing of the two-year interest rate differential between the euro area and the United States. Monetary policy convergence between the ECB and the Federal Reserve System seemed to have been a key driver of the euro’s appreciation. The scaling back of rate hike expectations had been greater in the United States than in the euro area. Positive economic data surprises in the euro area had also supported the euro, whereas rising downside risks to the US growth outlook had put pressure on the dollar. All in all, euro-dollar exchange rate developments were consistent with a more muted impact of the banking tensions on the economic outlook in the euro area than in the United States.
A third possible explanation for the repricing of interest rate expectations was related to financial stability concerns. With net outflows of deposits from euro area banks, market-based funding was becoming more important. However, short-term funding conditions in the interbank market had returned to pre-SVB conditions. The increase in credit and liquidity risk premia in money markets in mid-March had proved to be only temporary. Similarly, the effect on longer-term market funding conditions had been limited, and asset swap spreads of bank bonds had also almost returned to pre-SVB levels. At the same time, banks’ increasing use of longer-term bond market funding as an alternative to deposit funding tended to increase their average funding costs. Finally, the vulnerability of banks to rising interest rates depended not only on funding considerations but also on the assets side of their balance sheets. Overall, short-run risks to euro area banks from higher interest rates appeared to be contained.

Mr Lane went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting.
Global economic activity had been stronger than expected in early 2023. The global composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had risen further in March and reached 51.8 in the first quarter, up from 48.4 in the last quarter of 2022. At the same time, PMI data signalled a divergence between services, which continued to expand, and manufacturing, which had weakened further into contractionary territory. Since the services sector was less trade-intensive, world trade had remained weak. The euro had appreciated both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms. Compared with the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections, non-energy commodity prices had remained broadly unchanged, while the current oil futures curve was lower and slightly more steeply downward-sloping. The gas futures curve was also lower, although slightly more upward-sloping at the end of the year than embedded in the ECB projections.
Euro area GDP growth in the first quarter of the year – at 0.1% according to Eurostat’s preliminary flash estimate – had been broadly in line with the March staff projections. Excluding the strong negative growth rate for Ireland, it was slightly higher, at 0.2%. The available country data pointed to a positive contribution from net trade owing to buoyant exports, which was offset by a negative contribution from domestic demand. At the same time, developments differed significantly across countries, depending on the relative importance of services versus manufacturing. Lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support for firms and households had continued to shore up the economy. Manufacturing activity was still benefiting from a backlog of orders but its prospects were worsening, as was visible in the manufacturing output PMI for April. The services sector was growing more strongly, owing to the reopening of the economy.
Private domestic demand, especially consumption, was likely to have remained weak. Households were less inclined to purchase “big ticket” items, as the impulse from the additional savings accumulated over the pandemic had progressively waned and financing conditions were tightening. For instance, in the first two months of the year, retail sales and car registrations had declined from their levels at the end of 2022 by 0.4% and 3.7% respectively. The asset allocation of savings flows showed that households had accumulated money in bank accounts during 2020. However, the deposits were subsequently used by and large not to consume more but to invest in other financial assets or in capital formation, chiefly housing. Since 2022 they had also been used to repay debt, contributing to an increase in the saving ratio at the end of 2022.
Turning to investment, housing investment had been contracting since mid-2022. At the beginning of 2023, building construction had rebounded, thanks to good weather and the buffer from accumulated order backlogs, suggesting a temporary recovery in housing investment. However, the PMI for construction remained in negative territory, pointing to a subdued outlook. Affordability and profitability indicators had both declined sharply at the end of 2022. By contrast, non-housing investment and net exports were expected to have contributed positively to GDP growth in the first quarter of 2023. A recovery in capital goods had been helped by easing supply bottlenecks. However, the new orders PMI for capital goods remained in negative territory. As regards prospects for exports, the PMI for manufacturing orders had remained below the 50 threshold in April, while the PMI for services had returned to expansionary territory.
Looking ahead, model estimates and survey data pointed to a further moderate expansion of GDP in the second and third quarters of 2023, broadly in line with the March projection exercise.
The labour market had remained strong in the first few months of 2023. The unemployment rate had been relatively stable since April of the previous year and fallen to a new historical low of 6.5% in March 2023. Employment had grown steadily through higher labour force participation and higher immigration, with older and highly skilled workers behind the expansion. By contrast, average hours worked had been more sluggish. The employment outlook remained positive, according to the April PMI indicators, but with sectoral differences. The employment PMI for services had increased strongly, while the index for manufacturing had declined marginally, although it remained in expansionary territory. In the construction sector, the employment PMI had been in contractionary territory for a year.
Negotiated wage growth had increased strongly, to slightly above 5% in both January and February, from around 3% in December. But wage growth was more moderate if one-off payments were excluded, with rates of 3.1% in December, 3.7% in January and 3.8% in February. The latest settlements monitored in the ECB wage tracker implied comparable signals for wage growth over the coming 12 months, albeit with significant variation across countries. At the same time, the Indeed high-frequency job postings indicator of wage pressures had moderated since last October. The ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey showed that large companies expected margins to deteriorate in 2023 from elevated 2021-22 levels. The same firms indicated that they continued to expect wages to rise by 5% in 2023.
The fall in energy prices and easing supply bottlenecks, together with strong labour markets and rising wages, were expected to continue to support the economy in the coming months. Later in the year, however, less scope for catch-up dynamics and progressively tighter financing conditions were likely to act as a drag on economic growth.
According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual inflation rate had been 7.0% in April, having dropped from 8.5% in February to 6.9% in March. The uptick in April was due to a positive base effect for energy inflation. Services inflation had also increased slightly. The inflation rates for all other components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had declined. Inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) had been 5.6% in April, back to its February level after edging slightly higher in March. Food price inflation had remained elevated at 13.6% in April, after 15.5% in March and 15.0% in February. Overall, price pressures remained strong. The inflation momentum, measured as the annualised three-month over three-month price change, had showed a headline inflation rate of around 4% in April, with energy inflation deeply negative. Momentum had not yet declined for either food or services price inflation. It had decelerated slightly for goods inflation, but was still very high.
Indicators of underlying inflation were elevated and, for now, sent mixed signals. While exclusion-based and model-based measures were already declining, other indicators were only levelling off or still creeping up. Among those measures, the model-based Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) was declining more strongly than others since it was more quickly affected by the impact of declining energy prices. At the same time, domestic inflation was still increasing and was more indicative of pressures coming from wages. When information was taken from both indicators, the message was therefore mixed. So it was important to acknowledge that measures of underlying inflation would not be sending the same signal for a while, as there was a large relative price adjustment going on. On the one hand, there was a big decline in energy prices and, on the other hand, a big increase in the price of labour. Measures of underlying inflation that still included past energy shocks and the pressures from wages remained high. These measures were not a good predictor of where inflation would be one or two years from now, however, given the reversal of the energy shock, the easing of bottlenecks and the expectation that the catch-up in low real wage growth would fade over time.
Longer-term inflation expectations reported in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Consensus Economics survey and the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts had remained in the range of 2.0-2.1%. Financial market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased, but excluding higher inflation risk premia they had remained broadly unchanged and close to 2%. The upward movement in inflation expectations reflected in the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey also warranted ongoing monitoring.
Short-term euro area forward rates had increased since the beginning of April, partly reversing their earlier declines in the acute phase of the banking tensions. At present, the forward curve peaked at a rate of around 3.75%, to be reached in the third quarter of this year. Further out, the pricing indicated that increasing probability was attached to cuts in the key ECB interest rates starting in the second quarter of 2024.
Reflecting the rise in the risk-free yield curve, interest rates on bank loans had increased further, while overall credit flows remained low. Widening spreads between bank bonds and risk-free rates in the wake of the banking tensions were likely to affect bank lending behaviour. The latest bank lending survey showed a further strong net tightening in the standards applied by banks to corporate and housing loans, and banks cited higher risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance as the main drivers of their loan decisions. The share of rejected applicants had also increased for all loan categories. In parallel, banks reported declining demand for bank credit, owing to the general level of interest rates, weaker fixed investments for firms and worsening housing market prospects for households. Overall, this constituted a tightening impulse that was likely to add to the factors that were expected to weigh on economic growth and dampen inflation over the next two years.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
Following its March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council had announced that policy rate decisions would be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Overall, the incoming information broadly supported the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook formed at the March meeting. Headline inflation had declined significantly over recent months, but underlying price pressures remained strong. At the same time, the past rate hikes were being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remained uncertain.
The incoming information was sending a range of signals. Some developments were expected to dampen medium-term inflation dynamics: lower energy prices, the further easing of bottlenecks, the appreciation of the euro, the decline in global prospects for manufacturing and further global monetary tightening. In the other direction, the current strength of core and food price inflation, together with the level of recent wage agreements, posed upside risks to the March projections, especially in terms of the duration of the inflation adjustment process. Regarding underlying inflation, the signals were mixed: while exclusion-based and model-based measures had started to decline, the domestic and wage-intensive components of inflation were still rising. In addition, the momentum in some of these indicators continued to be substantial. In relation to monetary policy transmission, financing conditions continued to tighten. The latest bank lending survey indicated that the extent of credit tightening was stronger than previously expected by the banks, while the recent tensions in the global banking system might also add to risk aversion, curbing credit supply.
With these considerations in mind, the Governing Council needed to strike the right balance between advancing further towards interest rate levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure inflation returned to the 2% target in a timely manner and taking into account the elevated uncertainty regarding the speed and strength of the transmission of the cumulative tightening in the policy stance, including through the credit channel. This argued in favour of raising rates by an increment of 25 basis points at the present meeting. The Governing Council’s emphasis on data-dependence and on articulating the main criteria informing the rate decisions had been very effective in steadying policy expectations.
The APP portfolio was set to decline by €15 billion per month until the end of June 2023. The realised and expected balance sheet normalisation had so far complemented the tightening of policy interest rates in a smooth manner. Looking ahead, the latest Survey of Monetary Analysts had indicated that, beyond June, investors expected to see an acceleration in the pace of reduction of the APP portfolio to a rate that was consistent with a full run-off. To the extent this expectation was priced in by the market, the yield impact of discontinuing APP reinvestments as of July was expected to be small. Against this background, and in line with the Governing Council principle of data-dependence as well as its commitment to reduce the APP portfolio at a measured and predictable pace, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council communicate the expectation that reinvestments would be discontinued as of July. Expressing the decision as an expectation would preserve some flexibility in case adverse tail risks were to materialise, in particular with regard to financial market conditions.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that global growth excluding the euro area had been higher than expected since the start of the year. The upside surprises had been broad-based, in both advanced and emerging economies. In contrast to economic activity, global trade had been relatively weak over the last few months, as demand had rotated towards domestic services. The euro exchange rate had appreciated since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, which, looking ahead, would contribute to lower inflationary pressures for the euro area. Non-energy commodity prices were broadly unchanged. Oil prices had increased while gas prices had declined, extending their previous large decreases. High inventories had contributed to the improved gas price outlook. In the United States, economic activity was moderating, reflecting weakening domestic demand. In China, real GDP growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter from its pandemic-induced slump. The reopening of the Chinese economy, with higher than expected growth in China, was mentioned as an external factor that could contribute to lower core inflation in the euro area, as cheap Chinese imports had dampened inflation in Europe and the United States in the past. At the same time, higher demand from China could put upward pressure on global commodity prices, including energy.
With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members concurred with Mr Lane’s assessment that lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support for firms and households had contributed to the resilience of the economy. At the same time, private domestic demand, especially consumption, was likely to have remained weak. Business and consumer confidence had recovered steadily in recent months but remained weaker than before Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people. There was also a divergence across sectors of the economy. The manufacturing sector was working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects were worsening. The services sector, on the other hand, was growing more strongly, especially owing to the reopening of the economy. Household incomes were benefiting from the strength of the labour market.
Members highlighted the resilience of economic activity so far. The preliminary flash estimate for GDP growth in the first quarter of 2023 had been better than anticipated earlier, especially when taking into account that the aggregate number was most likely to have been pushed down by volatile transactions in Irish intellectual property products, while broadly in line with the March ECB staff projections. Moreover, incoming data suggested that growth could pick up further in the second and third quarters, in line with the March projections. This implied that the euro area economy would manage to escape a recession and that the exit from accommodative monetary policy had so far been smooth.
While the resilience of economic activity was seen as good news, it was nevertheless argued that strengthening activity would contribute to more persistent upward inflation pressures, making a timely return of inflation to target more difficult. However, it was also pointed out that the better than expected GDP growth had mainly been driven by a reversal in the terms-of-trade shock associated with lower energy prices, together with the easing of bottlenecks and an increase in labour supply, which was one factor supporting potential output. These favourable supply forces could allow an increase in GDP while at the same time also favouring disinflation.
The impact of tighter monetary policy was starting to become more visible in financing conditions in the early stages of transmission. At the same time, this raised the question of how much of the impact of tighter monetary policy was already in the pipeline and had yet to materialise, given the remaining uncertainty about long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy to output and inflation. In this context, it was mentioned that the impact of tighter monetary policy was becoming visible in non-financial companies’ perceptions of a weaker demand outlook, as flagged in the ECB’s latest Corporate Telephone Survey, as monetary policy was working through slowing aggregate demand. With respect to demand components, as financing conditions were tightening, investment was expected to weaken, partly as a result of the fair amount of uncertainty still clouding the outlook. As to private consumption, consumer services and tourism were still strengthening now that the pandemic had been overcome. Moreover, stronger tourism would also contribute to higher exports as non-euro area tourists returned to the euro area, a development that was not related to labour income growth due to domestic demand.
Members concurred that, as the energy crisis faded, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. In this context, it was argued that the current fiscal stance was out of line with the cyclical position of the economy. Moreover, if there were any fiscal tightening in the future it would likely be “too little too late” to be helpful in bringing inflation back to target. Especially as interest rates were rising, the question was whether governments would manage to tighten their fiscal stance at a time when higher inflation would increasingly weigh on public deficits, owing among other things to higher public wages and pension outlays. At the same time, it was mentioned that the size of the energy-related fiscal measures in 2023 and, as a consequence, the impact on inflation of their removal in 2024, would likely be revised down, in line with lower than expected energy prices. Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could also help reduce price pressures in the medium term. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded soon.
Against this background, the view was expressed that it was no longer evident that the balance of risks to economic activity was skewed to the downside, as had been judged at the preceding monetary policy meeting. Members nonetheless assessed that – even though recent market tensions related to stress in the banking system had largely subsided – renewed financial market tensions, if persistent, would pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth as they could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. Russia’s war against Ukraine also continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy. However, the recent reversal of past adverse supply shocks, if sustained, could spur confidence and support higher growth than currently expected. The continued resilience of the labour market, by bolstering household confidence and spending, could also lead to higher growth than anticipated.
With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation was still being pushed up by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases and supply bottlenecks. In services, especially, it was still being pushed higher also by pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and by rising wages. The information available up to March suggested that underlying inflation remained high. Wage pressures had strengthened further as employees, in a context of a robust labour market, recouped some of the purchasing power they had lost as a result of high inflation. Moreover, in some sectors firms had been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches between supply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation. Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, some indicators had edged up and warranted continued monitoring.
Members underlined that, while headline inflation had declined substantially from its earlier peak, the inflation outlook was still too high for too long. Inflation data had continued to surprise on the upside, for both headline and core inflation. All inflation components other than energy prices were significantly higher than had been expected in the March ECB staff projections. According to the mechanical update, headline and core inflation for 2023 would be higher than projected in March. Underlying inflation was proving more persistent, which was argued to point to clear upside risks to the latest projections. While it was felt that the outlook for headline inflation in the medium term remained similar to that in the March projections, developments in underlying inflation had become more worrisome and pointed to increased persistence. Momentum in all components except for energy remained very high or had even increased, especially for services. Against this background, the inflation outlook in the March projections was judged to be too optimistic, as there was still no robust evidence of a turning point in underlying inflation, with a rising risk of inflation becoming more entrenched owing to higher wage growth and of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.
However, it was also argued that the Governing Council should not focus too much on monthly inflation data being 0.1 percentage point higher or lower. What mattered was whether a downward trend in inflation could be expected over the medium term, in line with the projections. Moreover, with respect to changes in the projection assumptions since the March cut-off date, the latest developments in oil prices, food commodity prices and the exchange rate would together mechanically imply a downward impact on inflation, looking ahead. While there were forces, such as wages, that would push inflation up, there were also several factors going in the other direction, including rising interest rates, a stronger exchange rate, lower energy prices, easing supply bottlenecks, an increasing labour supply and lower fiscal subsidies, all of which would be disinflationary.
Food price inflation was widely seen as another important factor behind the still elevated level of headline inflation. Pipeline pressures suggested that the pass-through of past cost shocks to consumer food prices remained incomplete, posing significant upside risks to food inflation in 2023. This also represented an upside risk to prices in related areas such as restaurants and hotel services, and thus to underlying inflation. While commodity prices were falling steeply, consumer prices remained very sticky, suggesting that expanding profit margins were preventing inflation from falling. At the same time, it was argued that a large part of the currently elevated food price inflation could still be explained by higher energy prices. Moreover, there was a big transportation component in food prices, which was labour and energy-intensive.
As regards developments in core inflation, the latest developments were broadly seen as worrisome. The level and momentum of inflation excluding energy and food continued to be very high, so that small improvements in core inflation or other measures of underlying inflation should not be interpreted as an indication of a turning point. Reference was made to the United States, where the policy-relevant measures of core inflation had already started to decline some time ago, albeit at a slow pace. It was argued that underlying inflation in the euro area appeared to be more stubborn and was likely to be stickier than in the United States, since wage and price-setting were typically less flexible in Europe. The observed strength and persistence of core inflation were seen to call into question the earlier hypothesis that euro area inflation was to a larger extent supply-driven and due to external shocks than a result of domestic demand. It was also pointed out that the momentum of services inflation was clearly on the rise, indicating that wages – a key component of services inflation – would become increasingly important in explaining underlying inflation, especially given the resilience in the labour market. Moreover, the demand for hospitality services was expected to strengthen further over the coming months, which should give an additional boost to services and core inflation. In this context reference was made to the recent developments in wage negotiations in the public sector of the largest euro area country, and to evidence of non-linearities and greater persistence in the reaction to pipeline pressures, all of which were worrying for the outlook for underlying inflation.
At the same time, the point was made that, given the earlier large increases in energy prices, it was natural that core inflation would only start to decline with a considerable lag, as also suggested by historical regularities. In this context, it was recalled that there was no stable predictive relationship between core or other indicators of underlying inflation and headline inflation one to two years ahead. If anything, the causality between core and headline inflation went in the opposite direction. Against this background, the view was expressed that too much attention was paid to core inflation, first because core inflation was not representative of the household consumption basket, and second because core inflation had no clear leading indicator properties for future headline inflation. It would therefore be beneficial to explain that the analysis of underlying inflation pressures took a wide range of indicators into account and went well beyond core inflation.
Members recalled that the trend in wages was key to understanding medium-term inflation pressures. Even if it were the case that wage developments had so far remained broadly in line with the March ECB staff projections, this did not necessarily provide reassurance that the trend in wage increases would prove consistent with the ECB’s inflation target. Moreover, some of the latest wage increases, notably in the public sector, were widely seen as worrisome and had not been included in the March projections. There were clear signs that unions had regained bargaining power, which was unlikely to recede. Reference was also made to empirical evidence that the public sector played a leading role in private sector wage-setting in a number of euro area countries.
More generally, as high inflation became more protracted, this exacerbated the underlying social conflict between workers and employers. Moreover, while wage claims had for a long time been in line with domestic inflation and productivity growth, recent wage claims were clearly higher than levels that would be consistent with this regularity in future if inflation declined as anticipated. Wage growth was increasing, with further risks to the upside. In the euro area such developments typically started late and slowly, but they might be hard to stop. Negotiated wages (including one-off payments) had grown by more than 5% year on year in January and February 2023. There had been a significant increase in the growth rate of compensation per employee, which, together with the weakening of labour productivity growth, had implied a sharp increase in unit labour costs.
At the same time, there was already substantial evidence that the longer inflation remained high, the stronger demands for higher wages would become, with second-round effects on other prices. The social dialogue was seen as coming under increasing strain in a number of countries, suggesting that the argument about wages versus profit was becoming more intense. It was therefore contended that signs of a wage-profit-price spiral were emerging. In addition, a remark was made that higher mortgage rates might also induce workers to demand higher wages, giving rise to another channel through which inflation could perpetuate itself.
However, it was also recalled that there were considerable differences in wage developments, so all 20 euro area countries had to be taken together to see what the implications for monetary policy for the whole of the euro area would be. In this context, it was mentioned that there was no uniform message from recent wage indicators. Developments in negotiated wages and the ECB’s wage tracker pointed to a continued acceleration, but the signal from the latter indicator was affected by compositional and methodological issues. By contrast, information from the Indeed online job-matching platform, which covered new hiring, was showing a deceleration in wage dynamics. In addition, it was pointed out that the observed reduction in the unemployment rate reflected both an increase in new hires and a remarkable reduction in unemployment duration, suggesting that European labour markets had become much more fluid than they used to be. This should be positive for productivity and could indeed justify some wage increases if they were related to more robust productivity growth. However, it was also observed that no increase in productivity had been seen in the available macro data so far.
Finally, it was pointed out that the cumulative increase in prices between 2021 and 2024 would be around 20%. This meant that nominal wage increases observed over the past year would need to be put into the context of a “catching-up” process, by which employees were trying to compensate for the lower real wages received for much of the period. The March ECB staff projections had therefore expected significant wage increases, recognising that real wages were likely to recover over the projection horizon. Nonetheless, it was noted that the March projections did foresee inflation eventually coming back to target even with very substantial nominal wage increases. However, it was also argued that the cost of an adverse terms-of-trade shock could not be compensated but had to be shared between workers and employers. Moreover, the benign inflation outcome depicted in the baseline scenario of the staff projections was subject to large upside risks, as higher wages were likely to have a protracted impact and would increase inflation persistence, especially if not absorbed by lower profit margins.
Together with increasing wage pressures, recent elevated profits were seen as warranting closer monitoring. In some countries and sectors profit margins had grown very strongly at the end of last year. Unit profits in the euro area had contributed more than half of the domestic price pressures in the last quarter of 2022. As wage inflation had been much lower than price inflation, profits were plainly on the rise, with prices often clearly outpacing increases in input costs and wages. If wages were chasing prices and profits were chasing wages, this could be an explanation for the increased persistence of high inflation. To fully understand the implications for inflation, it was therefore important to see how profits would develop in the future. In this context, the Corporate Telephone Survey was sending a clear message, suggesting that companies had indeed been able to attain ample mark-ups in 2022, but they did not think that this would persist during the current year. As companies were passing on the higher input costs, it was likely that a reversal of this process would be seen in 2023, with wages contributing more and profits less, in line with past regularities.
As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members recalled that inflation expectations mattered a lot in wage negotiations. In particular, higher inflation expectations today could give rise to higher inflation over a prolonged period because of the long duration of wage agreements. Inflation expectations also mattered a lot in firms’ price-setting. Repeated upside surprises and target overshoots over a long period of time could erode trust in the ECB’s ability and willingness to bring inflation back to the 2% target. Maintaining the credibility of the ECB’s commitment to price stability was especially challenging in light of substantial lags in policy transmission. Attention was drawn to the increase in consumer inflation expectations in March. The question was raised as to whether this could be related to persistently high food inflation, with energy prices having declined significantly.
Against this background, a large number of members assessed the risks to price stability as being clearly tilted to the upside over the policy-relevant horizon, while other members judged that the risks were more symmetric, especially beyond the near term. Overall, the Governing Council assessed that there were still significant upside risks to the inflation outlook. These included existing pipeline pressures that could send retail prices higher than expected in the near term. Moreover, Russia’s war against Ukraine could again push up the costs of energy and food. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recently negotiated wage agreements had added to the upside risks to inflation, especially if profit margins remained high. The downside risks included renewed financial market tensions, which could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, due, for example, to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. Policy rate increases were being transmitted strongly to risk-free interest rates and to financing conditions for firms, households and banks. Growth in loans to firms and households had weakened owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply conditions and lower demand. The tightening of overall credit standards reported in the latest round of the bank lending survey was stronger than banks had expected in the previous survey round, which suggested that lending might weaken further. The observed weakness in lending meant that money growth had also continued to decline.
It was argued that some of the stronger tightening of credit standards reported in the survey, beyond the level that had been expected by banks in the previous survey round, was likely to be attributable to the recent tensions in the global banking system. At the same time, it was argued that there was no indication of a credit crunch and bank lending seemed to reflect mainly weaker loan demand rather than any quantitative constraints. The view was also expressed that it was surprising that the recent stress and uncertainty in the banking sector had had such a limited impact on the results of the bank lending survey, which had reported unchanged net tightening for loans to firms compared with the previous quarter and an expected deceleration in the pace of tightening in the period ahead. Moreover, it was recalled that the tightening of credit standards had come after a long period of very favourable credit developments, so, to some extent, it reflected a normalisation. In addition, it was felt that the observed tightening of bank lending standards and declining loan demand were welcome evidence that monetary policy transmission was working. Furthermore, access to financing was not seen as a major problem for firms, as was reflected in responses to the European Commission’s business survey regarding obstacles to production. However, credit developments were weakening. When measured in real terms, the contraction in loans to firms as a proportion of GDP was particularly pronounced and similar to the contractions observed in 2008 and in 2011.
Overall, members assessed financing conditions to have tightened since the March monetary policy meeting, while the picture of market-based financial conditions was mixed across markets. The acute strains that arose in financial markets in early March had diminished, as reflected in measures of systemic stress and volatility which had returned to levels seen prior to the emergence of the financial market tensions. Nevertheless, bank stock prices remained notably lower than before the tensions, although they were still higher than at the beginning of the year, while bank bond spreads over risk-free rates had widened somewhat. Banks’ funding costs had risen from low levels, as banks had to compensate for outflows from overnight deposits with more expensive time deposits and market-based debt. This would increase the supply pressure in the market for bank bonds, which was already elevated as banks took steps to pre-fund the large reimbursement due on the targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) expiring in June. Yet short-term funding conditions in the interbank market had returned to levels seen prior to the onset of the banking sector tensions. In this context, it was argued that the financial market tensions had led to both a faster increase in funding costs for banks and a faster transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions than previously expected.
Members expressed confidence in the resilience of European banks. Banks were increasingly reporting profits linked to rising net interest income. In this context, it was underlined that financial stress or instability was far from a level that might jeopardise the transmission of monetary policy. Nevertheless, financial fragilities might still surface, with the unprecedented policy rate tightening cycle exposing financial imbalances that had built up during the period of low interest rates. Against this background, the remark was made that it was, in any case, important to uphold the separation principle, which called for the monetary policy stance to be assessed independently of risks related to financial stability, with these being addressed, if needed, by dedicated means.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members evaluated the data obtained since the previous monetary policy meeting against the three criteria specified at the March meeting as being important in driving the Governing Council’s reaction to the unfolding circumstances. These criteria comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Starting with the inflation outlook, members broadly concurred with the assessment that, with inflation outturns having again surprised on the upside, the outlook continued to be for too high inflation for too long. The risk of a severe economic downturn and the risk of an impact on financial stability had both eased, and hence some of the factors exerting downward pressure on inflation had receded. These considerations tended to support the inference that inflation risks had moved further to the upside since the March monetary policy meeting. At the same time, commodity prices had fallen, financing conditions had tightened and the effective exchange rate of the euro had appreciated. On balance, weighing up the different factors, it could be concluded that the medium-term inflation outlook was still broadly consistent with the March staff projections.
Members assessed the evidence regarding measures of underlying inflation as being a source of concern. While core inflation had edged down slightly, indicators of underlying inflation ranged overall between 4% and 7%, giving a mixed picture. The momentum of services inflation was clearly on the rise, with wages expected to become increasingly important in explaining underlying inflation. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was still very high and its momentum was rising, while strong wage growth was expected to prevail, with the risk of more persistent inflation as well as the possibility of second-round effects.
Turning to the assessment of monetary policy transmission, members noted that there was now more solid evidence that monetary policy was being transmitted to financing and credit conditions. This was generally seen as a positive development, suggesting that the first stages of transmission were working. The still strong dynamics of underlying inflation could be a reflection of a slower than expected transmission of monetary policy to inflation. On the other hand, it was also argued that, with a very strong labour market and longer interest rate fixation periods for bank loans, transmission could be weaker than usual. However, it was noted that a further tightening of bank credit conditions was still in the pipeline, as the full extent of policy rate increases had not yet been reflected in bank lending rates and credit growth. Furthermore, uncertainty about the transmission channels was currently higher than usual. This was because the extra tightening impulse that, according to the bank lending survey, would result from banks’ more cautious lending decisions following the recent banking sector tensions, was hard to quantify precisely and warranted continuous monitoring.
Overall, it was felt that the conditions were not in place to “declare victory” or to be complacent about the inflation outlook. Instead, members concurred that further tightening was needed to bring inflation back to target over the medium term. High inflation was seen to be hurting the most vulnerable parts of society and weakening the euro area’s economic performance.
Emphasis was placed on the evidence that various measures of longer-term inflation expectations had edged up above 2%, indicating risks of an unanchoring of inflation expectations. In particular, market-based measures of longer-term expectations remained stubbornly high, which could partly be attributed to the level of risk premia, suggesting that investors saw upside risks to longer-term inflation prevailing over downside risks. Over shorter horizons, market-based measures of inflation expectations stood below staff inflation projections. Monitoring the inflation expectations of households and firms was also seen as important because they mattered in wage negotiations and firms’ price-setting.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Against this background, members agreed that a tightening of the monetary policy stance by increasing interest rates further was warranted.
A number of members initially expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in view of the risks to the inflation outlook posed by continued upside inflation surprises and inflation projected to be above target over at least four years, as well as by the elevated risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations. Such a step would more clearly demonstrate the Governing Council’s determination to achieve price stability in the face of elevated and more persistent inflation. More decisive action was warranted to move rates into sufficiently restrictive territory to ensure a timely return of inflation to target. These members saw the risk of tightening rates too much as being less than the risk of tightening them too little. Moreover, the view was expressed that the financial market turbulence had been short-lived and had not exerted a meaningful additional tightening impulse. Furthermore, the resilience of the euro area economy and receding recession risks, together with broadening price and wage pressures, suggested that underlying inflation was unlikely to decelerate sufficiently soon, which gave rise to increased risks of an unanchoring of expectations.
At the same time, most of these members indicated that they could accept the proposed rate increase of 25 basis points. The ECB’s communication should, however, convey a clear “directional bias” to underline that, on the basis of the present outlook, further interest rate increases would be warranted in order to return inflation to target and to avoid a smaller rate increase being misinterpreted as signalling the prospect of a pause in the current hiking cycle.
Against this background, almost all members supported the 25 basis point rate rise as proposed by Mr Lane, in combination with clear communication that, on the basis of the current data, monetary policy still had more ground to cover. This decision was seen as striking the right balance between meeting the need for further rate increases and accounting for elevated uncertainty about the speed and strength of monetary policy transmission. Since interest rates were already in restrictive territory, raising rates by 25 basis points was seen as preferable, including from a risk management perspective. This magnitude was viewed as prudent, with the possible costs of larger increments outweighing the benefits, given the still elevated uncertainty and the perception that the transmission of much of the impact of previous rate increases was still pending. In addition, the point was made that a smaller increment than those decided since July 2022 would allow the Governing Council to keep raising rates for longer, if underlying inflation pressures persisted or even strengthened through the summer, until there was sufficiently strong evidence that a turning point had been reached and inflation was retreating at an adequate pace. Emphasis was put on the merit of keeping to a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach in an uncertain environment and with rates moving closer to a possible “landing zone”. A return to a more standard size of rate increment was also justified in view of the fact that the various monetary policy instruments were reinforcing each other in the transmission of the monetary policy stance.
On this basis it was concluded that reducing the size of the increment from 50 to 25 basis points could be justified for two main reasons. First, substantial ground had been covered thus far, with the Governing Council having raised rates by 350 basis points over nine months, which implied that rates were getting closer to their destination, though they were not there yet. Second, the smaller rate increase also reflected uncertainty about the impact of past decisions, with a great deal of this impact still being in the pipeline. Slowing the pace of rate hikes was also seen as helping the right conclusions to be drawn about the destination. At the same time, it was underlined that reducing the size of the rate increment should not be interpreted as signalling that the Governing Council had opened the door to a pause in its monetary policy tightening cycle.
Members generally agreed that the data-dependent approach, combined with the communication about the ECB’s reaction function issued following the March meeting, had served the Governing Council well. Financial markets were assessing progress in terms of the inflation outlook, underlying inflation and the transmission of monetary policy, and were pricing in interest rates accordingly. It was argued that communication should emphasise the importance of being persistent and tenacious, and should make it clear that once the peak rate was reached rates would stay at that level for some time and the increases would not be reversed immediately.
As regards communication of the Governing Council’s directional bias, members agreed that it was appropriate to affirm that the Governing Council’s future decisions would ensure that the policy rates would be brought to levels that were sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target, and would be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. At the same time, there was a strong preference against returning to outright forward guidance on policy rates, which was not regarded as a suitable instrument when rates were well above their lower bound and was seen as inconsistent with the meeting-by-meeting approach to decision-making that remained warranted in a volatile environment.
Turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, members widely agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to announce the Governing Council’s expectation of discontinuing, as of July 2023, the reinvestment of maturing securities in the APP portfolio.
Members recalled the reasons why the balance sheet needed to be normalised. First, ending reinvestments in July was seen as being consistent with the current monetary policy stance and with the need to support the reduction in excess liquidity, complementing the expiry of the large TLTRO operation in June. In addition, progress with balance sheet normalisation was needed to regain policy space for possible future situations in which policy rates again came close to the lower bound and in order to adhere to the principle of proportionality. In this regard, while the APP had been introduced to provide additional monetary accommodation and to compress term premia when rates were at the lower bound, in the current conditions of ample excess liquidity and upside price pressures, the proportionality of continuing the partial reinvestment policy was questionable. Moreover, the current level of excess liquidity was not necessary to implement the desired monetary policy stance. Furthermore, normalisation was needed to reduce the side effects of a large balance sheet, including the risk of fiscal dominance, the exposure to credit and duration risk, and the impact on financial stability risks and on market functioning. Finally, from a longer-term perspective, a steeper yield curve would support banks’ intermediation capacity via maturity transformation. By contrast, keeping down term premia via the APP securities holdings for longer than necessary could negatively affect bank balance sheets and therefore the provision of credit to the private sector.
Members widely viewed financial markets as being able to digest a full portfolio run-off, having calmed after the turbulent weeks in mid-March. Market absorption had been very smooth even in times of market turbulence and despite relatively front-loaded government bond issuance this year. Overall, financial markets were seen as having largely priced in a full run-off by the summer, implying that the impact on long-term yields was likely to be limited.
It was recalled, however, that the reduction in the stock of securities held in the APP portfolio would be accompanied by a considerable decline in excess liquidity linked to the upcoming sizeable TLTRO repayments, with the largest coming due in June. Moreover, the fact that the June repayments were fully expected and priced in by markets did not preclude any impact if liquidity was withdrawn, because a fast contraction of the Eurosystem balance sheet could have wider implications for the financial sector. Over time there was likely to be some pressure on yields, a rise in interest rates on bank deposits, a rotation in household savings from investment funds back into term deposits as the rates on them increased, and a rise in demand for bonds from investment funds.
Reference was made to the need to monitor the composition of the APP portfolio in order to assess whether the composition across and within asset classes remained compatible both with the intended monetary policy stance and with the ECB’s Treaty requirement to support the general economic policies in the EU, as also reflected in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. In particular, a request was made to assess whether the overall composition of the portfolio remained aligned with climate goals of the Paris Agreement.
Caution was also expressed against too fast a contraction in the Eurosystem balance sheet. Owing to the TLTRO repayments, the expected pace of the reduction in the balance sheet was already quite fast, while the impact of the APP run-off on the lowering of inflation was seen as small. Moreover, the remark was made that the optimal size of the balance sheet in the long run was uncertain. Some members saw benefits in leaving an announcement about adjustments to APP reinvestments until June or in providing only a directional communication following the present meeting, while deciding on the exact calibration of reinvestments after the second quarter of 2023, at the June monetary policy meeting. This would allow a more complete assessment of the impact of TLTRO reimbursements in June amid lower liquidity during the summer months and was seen as beneficial in view of the high uncertainty and market volatility. Overall, the process of reducing reinvestments under the APP, including the Governing Council’s communication of this process, was seen as a success. The expected and realised balance sheet normalisation had already delivered a tightening of longer-term yields, thus supporting the policy stance, while at the same time not measurably increasing volatility.
Against this background, members were ready to join the consensus in support of Mr Lane’s proposal, subject to reiterating the principles of gradualism and predictability when announcing the expectation that reinvestment under the APP would be discontinued as of July.
Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

Banks reported a further substantial net tightening in credit standards for loans to firms and for house purchase
Demand for loans decreased strongly, driven by rising interest rates, lower fixed investment and weakening housing markets
Ongoing reduction in central bank balance sheet linked to TLTRO repayments and end of full APP reinvestments contributing to weakening lending dynamics
According to the April 2023 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further substantially (with the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening standing at 27%) in the first quarter of 2023 (see Chart 1). From a historical perspective, the pace of net tightening in credit standards remained at the highest level since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Banks also reported a further substantial net tightening of their credit standards for loans to households for house purchase, while the further net tightening became less pronounced for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentages of banks at 19% and 10% respectively). The tightening for loans to firms and for house purchase was stronger than banks had expected in the previous quarter and points to a persistent weakening of loan dynamics. The main drivers of the tightening were higher perceptions of risk and, to a lesser extent, banks’ lower risk tolerance. Against the backdrop of increases in ECB key interest rates and decreases in central bank liquidity, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. In the second quarter of 2023 euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate, tightening of credit standards on loans to firms and for house purchase. For consumer credit, euro area banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards at a similar pace as in the first quarter of 2023.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened further for loans to firms and loans to households in the first quarter of 2023. Widening margins on riskier loans and rising interest rates accounted for the main tightening effect, reflecting the ongoing pass-through of higher market rates to lending rates for firms and households.
Banks reported a strong net decrease in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the first quarter of 2023 (see Chart 2). The decline in net demand was stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter and is the strongest since the global financial crisis. The general level of interest rates was reported to be the main driver of reduced loan demand, in an environment of monetary policy tightening. Fixed investment also had a strong dampening effect on loan demand. The impact of inventories and working capital turned broadly neutral, after having previously had a positive impact on loan demand. This may reflect the easing of supply bottlenecks and a moderation in energy input costs. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further though smaller net decline in demand for loans to firms.
The net decrease in demand for housing loans remained strong and was close to the sharp net decrease reported for the previous quarter, which was the highest on record since the start of the survey in 2003. There was a smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households. Rising interest rates, weakening housing market prospects, low consumer confidence and a decline in spending on durable consumer goods contributed negatively to the demand for loans to households. In the second quarter of 2023 banks expect a further strong net decrease in housing loan demand and a somewhat smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit than in the first quarter.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail and wholesale funding deteriorated in the first quarter. For money markets and debt securities, the deterioration reverses the improvement in access to these markets registered at the end of last year, possibly reflecting the March 2023 market turmoil and the lower overall level of excess liquidity. For retail funding, the deterioration in access reflects the continued increase in bank deposit rates and shifts towards more highly remunerated types of saving.
Banks reported that the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio – for which changes can arise as a result of any transactions, including less than full reinvestments from maturing securities – had a negative impact on their market financing conditions, liquidity positions and total assets over the past six months. The reported impact on profitability was broadly neutral. Developments in the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio and the related tightening of monetary policy had a net tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans to firms and households and a negative impact on bank lending volumes across all categories of lending.
Euro area banks indicated that the ongoing phase-out of TLTRO III has had a negative impact on their liquidity positions, profitability and their overall funding conditions over the past six months in the context of TLTRO III funds maturing or being voluntarily repaid early. The phase-out of TLTRO III had a tightening impact on credit standards. The impact on lending volumes is expected to turn negative across all categories of lending over the next six months.
In response to a new question introduced in this survey round, euro area banks have indicated that the ECB key interest rate decisions have had a marked positive impact on their net interest margins over the past six months. At the same time, while the impact on overall bank profitability was positive, the positive impact on banks’ interest margins was partly offset by a negative volume effect on net interest income. This is in line with the substantial weakening of loan and deposit dynamics over the past six months. Additional negative impacts stemmed from capital losses and net fee and commission income.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the April 2023 survey relate to changes observed in the first quarter of 2023 and expected changes in the second quarter of 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The April 2023 survey round was conducted between 22 March and 6 April 2023. In this round, the size of the sample of banks surveyed was increased to 158 banks, mainly reflecting the enlargement of the euro area to include Croatia on 1 January 2023. The response rate was 100%.

,"Introduction
The results reported in the April 2023 bank lending survey (BLS) relate to changes observed during the first quarter of 2023 and expectations for the second quarter of 2023. The survey was conducted between 22 March and 6 April 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, the size of the sample was increased to 158 banks, reflecting mainly the enlargement of the euro area to include Croatia on 1 January 2023. The response rate was 100%. In addition to results for the euro area as a whole, this report also contains results for the four largest euro area countries.

A number of ad hoc questions were included in the April 2023 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio and TLTRO III on banks and their lending policies, and the impact of ECB key interest rate decisions on bank profitability.
1 Overview of results
In the April 2023 BLS, euro area banks indicated that their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further substantially in the first quarter of 2023. From a historical perspective, the pace of net tightening in credit standards remained at the highest level since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011. The tightening was stronger than banks had expected in the previous quarter and points to a persistent weakening of loan dynamics. Risks related to the economic outlook and firm-specific situation remained the main driver of the tightening of credit standards, while banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed. The tightening impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation on credit standards for loans to firms remained contained and broadly unchanged compared with the previous quarter. In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate tightening for loans to firms.
Banks also reported a further substantial net tightening of credit standards for housing loans in the first quarter of 2023, while the net tightening became less pronounced for consumer credit. The net tightening of credit standards on housing loans was mainly owing to banks’ higher risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance, while the tightening contribution of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints remained contained. In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate, net tightening for loans to households for house purchase and a further net tightening at a similar pace as in the first quarter for consumer credit.
Firms’ net demand for loans fell strongly in the first quarter of 2023. The decline in net demand was stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter and the strongest since the global financial crisis. The general level of interest rates was reported as the main driver of reduced loan demand, in an environment of monetary policy tightening. Fixed investment also had a strong dampening impact while the impact of inventories and working capital turned broadly neutral, after having previously had a positive impact on loan demand. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, albeit smaller net decline in demand for loans to firms.
The net decrease in housing loan demand remained strong and close to the sharp net decrease in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was the highest since the start of the survey in 2003. It was driven by higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence. By contrast, the net decrease in demand for consumer credit became smaller. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a markedly less pronounced decrease in housing loan demand and a somewhat smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit than in the first quarter.
In more detail, euro area banks tightened further substantially their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the first quarter of 2023 (net percentage of banks at 27%, after 27% in the previous quarter; see Overview table), i.e. the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was substantially larger than the percentage of banks reporting an easing. From a historical perspective, the pace of net tightening in credit standards remained at the highest level since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011. The tightening was stronger than banks had expected in the previous quarter and points to a persistent weakening of loan dynamics. Banks’ risk perceptions continued to have the strongest tightening contribution, while declining risk tolerance also contributed towards a tightening. The impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints remained contained and in line with the impact registered in the previous quarter. Within the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, the largest contributor towards a tightening was banks’ liquidity position, likely also reflecting the decrease in central bank liquidity support, in the context of ongoing TLTRO repayments. In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate, net tightening of credit standards relative to the first quarter (net percentage of 15%).
For housing loans, euro area banks reported a further substantial net tightening of credit standards in the first quarter of 2023, at a similar pace as in the previous quarter (net percentage of banks of 19%, after 21% in the previous quarter; see Overview table), while the additional tightening became moderate for consumer credit (10%, after 17%). For housing loans, the net tightening was above banks’ expectations in the previous quarter (net percentage of 13%), but remained markedly below the peak observed in the third quarter of 2022. For consumer credit, the net tightening was broadly in line with banks’ expectations (net percentage of 13%). The main drivers of the tightening for both housing loans and consumer credit were higher risk perceptions and, to a lesser extent, banks’ lower risk tolerance. The tightening contribution of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints remained contained and broadly unchanged from the previous quarter. Similar to the credit standards applied to loans to firms, the tightening was mainly on account of banks’ decreasing liquidity position. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, though more moderate, net tightening of credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of 6%). For consumer credit, they expect a further net tightening of credit standards at a similar pace as in the first quarter of 2023 (12%).
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to firms and households tightened further. For firms, the difference between the percentage of banks reporting a tightening and the percentage of banks reporting an easing was still substantial but lower than the last quarter (net percentage of 24%, after 38%). The widening of margins on riskier loans had the strongest tightening contribution. Margins on average loans widened but at a lesser pace than in the previous quarter, while collateral requirements also had a tightening impact on terms and conditions. Banks also reported a further net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans (net percentage of 26%, after 31%) and consumer credit and other lending to households (18%, after 21%). For both, the tightening was mainly on account of the rising level of interest rates (part of “other factors”) and, especially for housing loans, widening margins on riskier loans, reflecting the ongoing pass-through of higher market rates to mortgage rates and consumer credit rates. At the same time, competition contributed to an easing of banks’ terms and conditions for loans to households.
In the first quarter of 2023, banks reported a widespread increase in the share of rejected applications for all loan categories, reaching – for loans to firms – the highest net percentage registered since the question was first asked in 2015 (net percentage of 15%, after 12% in the previous quarter). This is consistent with a further tightening of credit standards, which makes banks increasingly more likely to reject loan applications despite the decrease in loan demand. For housing loans and consumer credit, the further net increase in the share of rejected applications, although reported by fewer banks compared with the previous quarter, remains at historically high levels (17% after 27%, and 10% after 19% respectively).
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in net terms in all four of the largest euro area countries in the first quarter of 2023 (see Overview table). Credit standards for housing loans also tightened across all four largest euro area countries in the first quarter, while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in Germany and Spain and remained unchanged in France and Italy.
Firms’ net demand for loans decreased strongly in the first quarter of 2023 (net percentage of -38%, after -12% in the previous quarter; see Overview table), which is the largest net decline since the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline was stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. The general level of interest rates was reported as the main driver of reduced loan demand, in an environment of monetary policy tightening. Fixed investment also had a strong dampening impact on loan demand. The impact of inventories and working capital turned broadly neutral, after having previously had a positive impact on loan demand, which may reflect the easing of supply bottlenecks and a moderation in energy input costs. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, albeit smaller net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -18%).
The net decrease in demand for housing loans remained strong in the first quarter of 2023 and close to the sharp net decrease in the previous quarter (net percentage of -72%, after -74% in the previous quarter; see Overview table). Both decreases were stronger than in any other quarter since the beginning of the survey in 2003. The decrease in the first quarter was stronger than expected by banks in the fourth quarter of 2022. Higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence all contributed negatively to the demand for loans for house purchase. By contrast, the net decrease in demand for consumer credit became smaller (net percentage of -19%, after -30%, see Overview table), broadly in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter. Higher interest rates, low consumer confidence and declining spending on durable consumer goods contributed to lower demand. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, although less strong decrease in housing loan demand (net percentage of -39%) and a similar net decrease in demand for consumer credit (-16%) than in the first quarter.
Banks reported a net decrease in demand for loans across all four largest euro area countries in the first quarter of 2023. Across all four largest countries, demand for loans to enterprises decreased in net terms. In addition, net demand for housing loans decreased substantially in all four largest euro area countries, with very large net decreases in Germany, Spain and France. Demand for consumer credit decreased in net terms in Germany, Spain and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, while it remained unchanged in France.
Overview table
Latest BLS results for the largest euro area countries
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards or an increase in loan demand)
Notes: “Avg.” refers to historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.
The April 2023 BLS also contained a number of ad hoc questions. Euro area banks reported that their access to retail and wholesale funding deteriorated in the first quarter of 2023. For money markets and debt securities, the deterioration reverses the improvement in the access to these markets registered at the end of last year, possibly reflecting the March 2023 market turmoil, the lower overall level of excess liquidity and the increased collateral availability that had stemmed from TLTRO III voluntary early repayments in the last quarter of 2022. For retail funding, the pace of deterioration in access to funding remained similar to the previous quarter and reflects the continued increase in bank deposit rates and shifts towards more highly remunerated types of saving. In the second quarter of 2023, access to all sources of retail and wholesale funds is expected to deteriorate further.
Banks reported that the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio – for which changes can arise as a result of any transactions, including less than full reinvestments – had a negative impact on their market financing conditions, liquidity positions and total assets over the last six months. Banks also noted that the impact on profitability was broadly neutral, although the impact via capital losses remained negative. The ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio also had a net tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans to firms and households, while there was a negative impact on lending volumes across all categories of lending for the first time since this question was introduced. Banks expect that the impact on market financing conditions, liquidity positions and total assets will continue to be negative over the next six months, while the tightening impact on terms and conditions and the negative impact on lending volumes are also expected to continue.
Euro area banks indicated a negative impact of the ongoing phase-out of TLTRO III on their liquidity positions, profitability and their overall funding conditions over the last six months, which is expected to continue over the next six months against the backdrop of TLTRO III funds maturing or being voluntarily repaid early, leading to a reduction in lending volumes. TLTRO III had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms, and a small net tightening impact on loans to households. Over the next six months, credit standards are expected to tighten further especially as a consequence of the largest remaining TLTRO III operation maturing in June 2023. Against the same backdrop, while the impact on terms and conditions was still only slightly tilted towards tightening over the past six months, the phase-out of TLTRO III is expected to lead to a widespread tightening over the second and third quarter of this year. The impact on lending volumes is expected to turn negative across all categories of lending over the next six months.
Euro area banks indicated a markedly positive impact of the ECB key interest rate decisions on their net interest margins over the past six months, according to a new question which was introduced in this survey round. The positive impact on bank interest margins also translated into a high share of banks reporting a positive impact of the ECB rate hikes on their net interest income, which led to a largely positive effect on their overall profitability. At the same time, the impact of the interest rate decisions on volumes was negative, consistent with sharply decelerating loan demand as reported elsewhere in the survey and weakening deposit dynamics. Moreover, euro area banks reported a negative impact of the ECB interest rate decisions on their non-interest income, due to both capital losses and lower net fee and commission income, and a negative impact via higher provisioning needs and impairments. Banks expect mostly similar impacts of the ECB key interest rate decisions on the components of bank profitability over the next six months, except for capital losses, which banks expect to be lower.

General notes
The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 158 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.

BLS questionnaire
The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e. domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat, or (5) eased/increased considerably.
In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).
Aggregation of banks’ replies to national and euro area BLS results
The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.
In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.
[

]
For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.
In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares in lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.
BLS indicators
Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e. they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.
[

]
The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.
A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).
Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e. an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.
In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.
In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.
Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via the Statistical Data Warehouse.
A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on the ECB's website.
2 Developments in credit standards, terms and conditions, and net demand for loans in the euro area
2.1 Loans to enterprises
2.1.1 Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened further substantially
Euro area banks tightened further substantially their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the first quarter of 2023, i.e. the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was substantially larger than the percentage of banks reporting an easing (net percentage of banks of 27%, after 27% in the fourth quarter of 2022; see Chart 1 and Overview table). The net tightening in credit standards was stronger than banks had expected in the previous quarter and points to a persistent weakening of loan dynamics. Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the pace of net tightening in credit standards for the last two quarters is the largest seen since the sovereign debt crisis (net percentage of 35% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011). Credit standards tightened to a similar extent for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs; net percentage of 23%, after 22%) and for loans to large firms (24%, after 20%; see Chart 2). At the same time, the tightening was stronger for long-term loans (28%, after 27%) than for short-term loans (17%, after 20%).
Risks related to the economic outlook and industry or firm-specific situation had the largest tightening impact on credit standards for firms (see Chart 1 and Table 1). To a lesser extent, banks’ declining risk tolerance also had a tightening impact. The significant tightening impact is broadly in line with developments in the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator, which remained slightly below its long-run average in the first quarter. Against the backdrop of increases in ECB key interest rates and decreases in central bank liquidity, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. Within the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, the largest contributor towards a tightening was banks’ liquidity position, likely also reflecting a decrease in central bank liquidity associated with maturing and early repayments of TLTRO III funds and, since March, the lower reinvestments of ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio (see Section 4). Factors contributing to changes in credit standards were similar for SMEs and large enterprises.

(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.

Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened across all four largest euro area countries, driven mainly by higher risk perceptions. Declining risk tolerance and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions also had a tightening contribution in France, Italy and Spain. In Germany, the contribution of cost of funds and balance sheet conditions was broadly neutral, although there was a small tightening impact of banks’ access to market financing.
In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate, net tightening of credit standards relative to the first quarter (net percentage of 15%). Banks expect a net tightening both for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 12%) and large enterprises (net percentage of 13%).
Table 1
Factors contributing to changes in credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
2.1.2 Terms and conditions on loans to enterprises tightened further
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened further in the first quarter of 2023 (net percentage of 24%, after 38%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). There was a nil percentage of banks reporting an easing of overall terms and conditions, with the net percentage being driven by banks reporting a tightening, although to a lesser extent than in the last quarter. Tighter terms and conditions are confirmed by the continued rise in the aggregate cost of borrowing for firms seen in currently available interest rate data for the first quarter. The tightening in terms and conditions was mainly on account of a widening in margins (defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) on riskier loans (net percentage of 20%) and to a lesser extent on average loans (net percentage of 8%). The widening of margins on riskier loans was broadly in line with the previous quarter, while the widening of margins on average loans was less pronounced. Collateral requirements (net percentage of 7%) and other terms and conditions also had a tightening impact on firms’ overall terms and conditions. Banks reported a further substantial, albeit lower, net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to both SMEs and large firms (see Chart 4). For both categories of lending, loan margins widened more for riskier loans than for average loans.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “non-interest rate charges”, “size of the loan or credit line”, “loan covenants” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Chart 4
Changes in terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Note: See the notes to Chart 3.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions, decreased risk tolerance, and cost of funds and balance sheet constraints continued to be the main drivers of the net tightening in overall terms and conditions for loans to firms in the first quarter of 2023 (see Table 3), with rising inter-bank competition counterbalancing the trend. Risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of firms had a large tightening impact on terms and conditions, whereas the impact of the collateral demanded was more moderate. In the context of increases in ECB key interest rates and decreases in the central bank balance sheet, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed towards the tightening, with the largest contribution from costs related to market financing. On the other hand, competition had an easing impact, driven by increased inter-bank competition, which can partially explain the lower pace of tightening in the first quarter.

(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. See the notes to Chart 1.
In all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions tightened on loans or credit lines to enterprises. In Germany, the net tightening was lower relative to the other three largest euro area countries. Margins on riskier loans contributed towards a tightening across all four of the largest euro area countries, while margins on average loans had an easing impact in France, and a tightening impact in Germany, Italy and Spain. Banks in Germany, Italy and Spain also cited collateral requirements as having a tightening impact. In Italy, banks referred to the level of interest rates and increases of benchmark rates (in the “other factors”) having a tightening impact as well as to other terms and conditions, with the largest tightening impact amongst these being driven by restrictions on loan sizes and tighter maturity conditions.
2.1.3 Rejection rate for loans to enterprises increased
Euro area banks reported in the first quarter of 2023 the largest net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms since this question was introduced in 2015 (net percentage of 15%, after 12% in the previous quarter; see Chart 5). This development is consistent with a further tightening in credit standards, which makes banks more likely to reject loan applications despite the decrease in loan demand. The net increase in the share of rejected loan applications was similar for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 11%, after 11%) and for loans to large firms (net percentage of 10%, after 10%).

Changes in the share of rejected loan applications for enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase)
Notes: Share of rejected loan applications relative to the volume of all loan applications in that loan category. The breakdown by firm sizes was introduced in the first quarter of 2022.
Banks in France, Germany and Spain reported a net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms in the first quarter of 2023, while there was no change in the share of rejected applications in Italy. The net share of rejected loan application increased for both SMEs and large enterprises in Germany, France and Spain, while the share of rejected applications slightly decreased for SMEs in Italy.
2.1.4 Net demand for loans to enterprises decreased strongly
According to euro area banks, firms’ net demand for loans decreased strongly in the first quarter of 2023 (net percentage of -38%, after -12% in the previous quarter; see Chart 6). This is the largest net decline since the fourth quarter of 2008 which was the strongest decline seen during the global financial crisis. The decline was stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. Loan demand decreased in net terms for SMEs (net percentage of -37%, see Chart 7) and large firms (net percentage of -31%). The net decrease in demand was particularly strong for long-term loans, at a pace similar to the highest rate seen during the global financial crisis (-45%, compared with -43% in the first quarter of 2009), while demand for short-term loans decreased to a lesser extent (-11%) after being broadly unchanged in the previous quarter.
Chart 6
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.
Chart 7
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 6. Developments in the factors having an impact on loan demand across firm sizes were added in the first quarter of 2022.
In the context of monetary policy tightening, the general level of interest rates was the main driver of reduced loan demand (net percentage of -40%, see Chart 6 and Table 4). In addition, fixed investment had a further dampening impact on loan demand (net percentage of -33%). The contribution of inventories and working capital turned neutral (net percentage of 0%) having previously had a positive impact on loan demand, which may reflect the easing of supply bottlenecks and a moderation in energy input costs. These developments reflect the latest euro area manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for March, in which supplier delivery times improved strongly and manufacturing input prices fell for the first time in almost three years, with a negative contribution from lower energy input costs. The use of alternative financing had an overall broadly neutral impact on loan demand (net percentage of -1%). On the one hand, debt security issuance had a positive impact (net percentage of 4%), suggesting some banks are seeing an increase in loan demand due to reduced issuance of corporate debt securities. On the other hand, the use of internal financing associated with improved corporate profitability had a dampening impact (net percentage of -10%). Other financing needs had an overall dampening impact on loan demand (net percentage of -9%), mainly due to financing needs relating to mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring (net percentage of -18%). For both SMEs and large firms, the general level of interest rates and firms’ financing needs related to fixed investment had a large dampening impact on demand (see Chart 7).
Table 4
Factors contributing to changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 6.
Demand for loans to firms fell across all four largest euro area countries. The general level of interest rates and financing needs related to fixed investment had a notable negative contribution to demand across all four large countries. The effect of inventories and working capital was more heterogeneous, with banks in Germany and Italy reporting a positive contribution towards loan demand, possibly pointing to input costs related to high energy prices or other short-term financing needs of firms such as remaining supply bottlenecks, while in France and Spain there was a dampening contribution. Banks in all four countries indicated that other financing needs, mostly related to mergers and acquisitions, had a negative contribution towards demand.
In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, albeit smaller, net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -18%). Banks expect a significant, albeit smaller, decrease in demand for long-term loans (net percentage of -22%), while the demand for short-term loans is expected to decrease to a lesser extent (net percentage of -6%). Net demand for loans to both SMEs (net percentage of -16%) and large firms (net percentage of -17%) are expected to decrease at similar rates.
2.2 Loans to households for house purchase
2.2.1 Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened further substantially
In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks tightened further substantially their credit standards on loans to households for house purchase, at a similar pace as in the previous quarter (net percentage of banks at 19%, after 21% in the previous quarter). The pace of the tightening remained markedly below the peak observed in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 8 and Overview table). It also remained below the tightening peaks reached during the pandemic, the sovereign debt crisis and especially the global financial crisis.
Chart 8
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “housing market prospects, including expected house price developments” and “borrower’s creditworthiness”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions were the main factor driving the net tightening of credit standards, albeit to a lesser extent than in the previous quarter (see Chart 8 and Table 5). This was mainly related to banks’ concerns regarding the general economic outlook, for which the additional tightening impact became smaller compared with the previous quarter, which would be consistent with a still subdued but improved outlook for euro area economic growth in the first quarter. In addition, banks’ lower risk tolerance continued to contribute to the tightening. The tightening contribution of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints remained contained. Similar to the credit standards applied to loans to firms, the tightening was mainly driven by banks’ liquidity positions. By contrast, the tightening impact of banks’ costs related to their capital positions and market financing remained small, also reflecting euro area banks’ solid capital position.
Across all four largest euro area countries, credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened in net terms. In most of these countries, banks’ risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance were the main drivers of the net tightening. At the same time, banks in Spain and France particularly referred to a tightening impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, either due to their market financing conditions (Spain) or liquidity positions (France and Spain), while the costs related to their capital position did not play a role. Spanish banks also reported a net easing impact associated with increased competition from other banks.
In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate, net tightening of credit standards on loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of 6%).
Table 5
Factors contributing to changes in credit standards for loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 8.
2.2.2 Terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase tightened further
Banks reported a further net tightening of their overall terms and conditions for new housing loans in the first quarter of 2023 (net percentage of 26%, after 31% in the previous quarter; see Chart 9 and Table 6). The net tightening of banks’ overall terms and conditions was mainly on account of the rising level of interest rates (part of “other factors”) and widening margins on riskier loans, reflecting the ongoing pass-through of higher market rates to mortgage rates and concerns about credit risks. In addition, banks mentioned a small tightening contribution of margins on average loans, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, other loan size limits (part of “other terms and conditions”) and loan maturities.

Table 6
Changes in terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 9.
Banks’ higher cost of funds and balance sheet situation made the strongest contribution to the net tightening of overall terms and conditions (see Table 7), while competition exerted a widespread easing impact. In addition, banks also mentioned the following as contributors to the tightening of their overall terms and conditions: the level of interest rates, the higher market reference rates to which mortgage loans are linked and the increase in the usury rate in France
[

]
(see developments by country below). The tightening impact of banks’ risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance became smaller compared with the previous quarter, suggesting that banks did not see economic risks increasing further in the first quarter. By contrast, competition had a net easing impact on terms and conditions.
In most of the large euro area economies, overall terms and conditions for housing loans tightened in net terms. In Italy and Spain, banks referred to the rising level of interest rates (included in “other factors”) in addition to widening loan margins, contributing to tighter overall terms and conditions. By contrast, in Germany, banks reported a net easing of their overall terms and conditions, driven by loan margins. This is in line with the more limited increase in mortgage rates on new loans in Germany in the first quarter compared with the other large euro area countries. The main factor behind this development was intensified competition, which may be related to the strong decrease in demand for housing loans and competition for borrowers between banks. In France, banks referred to a widening of loan margins, partly on account of the update of the administrative threshold for a lending rate to be classified as usury rate (part of “other factors”; see footnote 5). This allowed banks in France to increase the pass-through of ECB rate hikes to mortgage rates, after several quarters in which they had reported a narrowing of loan margins due to the legal constraint of the usury rate. The dominant factor contributing to the tightening of overall terms and conditions in Spain, France and Italy were banks’ funding costs, while competition had an easing impact in Germany, Spain and Italy.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.2.3 Rejection rate for housing loans increased
In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected applications for housing loans, albeit lower than in the previous quarter (net percentage of 17%, after 27%; see Chart 10). This is broadly in line with the moderation in the additional tightening of credit standards in the last two quarters. At the same time, the still substantial net share may reflect banks’ concerns about households’ debt servicing capacity in an environment of higher cost of living and rising interest rates. Banks in Germany, Spain and France reported a net increase in the percentage share of rejected loan applications. By contrast with the other three largest euro area countries, Italian banks reported a net decrease in the share of rejected loan applications.

(net percentages of banks reporting an increase)
Notes: Share of rejected loan applications relative to the volume of all loan applications in that loan category.
2.2.4 Net demand for housing loans decreased strongly
The net decrease in housing loan demand remained strong and close to the sharp net decrease in the fourth quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of -72%, after -74% in the previous quarter; see Chart 11 and Overview table). Both decreases were stronger than in any other quarter since the beginning of the survey in 2003 and consistently stronger than expected by banks in the quarter before.
Chart 11
Changes in demand for loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation” and “regulatory and fiscal regime of housing markets”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal finance of house purchase out of savings/down payment”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”.
Higher interest rates, weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence all contributed negatively to the demand for loans for house purchase (see Chart 11 and Table 8). For the third quarter in a row, the general level of interest rates remained the main negative contributor to housing loan demand. The negative impact of consumer confidence and housing market prospects was again sizeable in the first quarter of 2023, but remained less negative than the extreme values during the global financial crisis. The development of these factors is in line with the current environment of considerable rises in mortgage rates for euro area households and a substantial slowdown in the annual growth of euro area house prices. Additionally, the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator remained well below its long-term average for the euro area up to March. To a small extent, other financing needs and the use of alternative finance, mainly due to loans from other banks, also contributed negatively to demand, which is in line with the reported strong competition between banks for granting new housing loans in an increasingly narrow market.
Demand for housing loans decreased substantially in all four largest euro area countries, with very large net decreases in Germany, Spain and France. The general level of interest rates, consumer confidence and housing market prospects all had a downward impact on demand in all four countries. Among these factors, rising interest rates had the strongest dampening impact in all countries. The negative impact of housing market prospects was larger in Germany and France than in Spain and Italy.
In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further, although less strong decrease in housing loan demand (net percentage of banks of -39%).

Note: See the notes to Chart 11.
2.3 Consumer credit and other lending to households
2.3.1 Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened moderately further
Banks reported a moderate further net tightening of credit standards on consumer credit and other lending to households in the first quarter of 2023, which was less pronounced than in the previous quarter (net percentage of 10% after 17% in the previous quarter; see Chart 12 and Overview table). This was broadly in line with banks’ expectations in the previous quarter (net percentage of 13%).
Increased risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance mainly contributed to the net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit (see Chart 12 and Table 9). This was mostly related to banks’ perceptions of the economic outlook and consumers’ creditworthiness. The tightening impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions remained contained, with small contributions from banks’ liquidity positions, funding costs, capital positions and market financing.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms in Germany and Spain, while they were unchanged on balance in France and Italy. Higher risk perceptions and, to a lesser extent, banks’ lower risk tolerance, contributed to the net tightening in Germany and Spain, while banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also had a relevant tightening impact in Spain.
In the second quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households at a similar pace as in the first quarter (net percentage of 12%).

2.3.2 Terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households tightened further
Banks’ overall terms and conditions applied when granting consumer credit and other lending to households tightened further in net terms in the first quarter of 2023 (net percentage of 18%, after 21% in the previous quarter; see Chart 13 and Table 10). Euro area banks referred mainly to a tightening impact of rising interest rates (part of “other factors”) and, to a small extent, a widening of margins on riskier loans.
Chart 13
Changes in terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “size of the loan”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Risk perceptions contributed most to the net tightening of banks’ overall terms and conditions (see Table 11). Rising interest rates and banks’ lower risk tolerance also had a tightening impact on overall terms and conditions, while competition had a net easing impact.
Across all four of the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms. Banks in Germany and Spain reported a widening of loan margins, reflecting the pass-through of higher market rates to lending rates for consumers. By contrast, banks in Italy referred to a narrowing of loan margins in the first quarter, related to the further increase in the general level of interest rates (included in “other factors”), which has not yet been fully passed through to borrowers. Banks in France reported a net tightening of their terms and conditions in the first quarter partly on account of the monthly update of the usury rate (see footnote 5 above). In all of the largest countries, both banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation as well as risk perceptions played a relevant role in the tightening of terms and conditions, while competition contributed to an easing in Spain and Italy.

Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.3.3 Rejection rate for consumer credit and other lending to households increased at a lower rate
Euro area banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected applications for consumer credit at a lower rate compared with the previous quarter (10%, after 19% in the previous quarter; see Chart 10 above). Across the largest euro area countries, the net increase in the share of rejected loan applications diminished in Germany and France, while the net percentage of banks reporting an increased share became more pronounced in Spain. In Italy, banks reported a net decrease in the share of loan rejections for consumer credit.
2.3.4 Net demand for consumer credit and other lending to households decreased at a smaller rate
In the first quarter of 2023, banks reported a smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of banks at -19%, after -30% in the previous quarter; see Chart 14 and Overview table). This decline was broadly in line with what banks had expected in the previous quarter (-18%).
Chart 14
Changes in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing out of savings”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”. “Consumption exp. (real estate)” denotes “consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans”.
Higher interest rates, low consumer confidence and a net decline in spending on durable consumer goods contributed, in net terms, to lower demand (see Chart 14 and Table 12). All three factors had a smaller contribution towards the fall in demand relative to the previous quarter. These developments are consistent with the dampening impact of high inflation and elevated energy costs on households’ real disposable income. While the dampening impact remained strong, the moderation in inflation and the reduction in energy supply-related uncertainty improved somewhat the situation for consumers in the first quarter, which may have played a role in the smaller net decrease in loan demand for consumer durables. In addition, the downward impact of consumer confidence in the BLS is consistent with the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator, which remained below its long-term average in the first quarter.
Across the four largest euro area countries, demand for consumer credit decreased in net terms in Germany, Spain and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, while it remained unchanged in France. The general level of interest rates, low consumer confidence and a net decline in the spending for consumer durables contributed negatively towards demand in all four countries.
In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a somewhat smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of -16%).

3 Ad hoc questions
3.1 Banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding[6]
Euro area banks reported that their access to retail and wholesale funding had deteriorated in the first quarter of 2023. For money markets and debt securities (net percentages of banks at 7% and 13% respectively; see Chart 15), the deterioration reverses the improvement in the access to these markets registered at the end of last year, possibly reflecting the March 2023 market turmoil, the lower overall level of excess liquidity and the increased collateral availability that had stemmed from TLTRO III voluntary early repayments in the last quarter of 2022. The impact of the turmoil also tends to be supported by the fact that the reported deterioration was larger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. The reported deterioration was similar for short-term and longer-term debt securities (net percentages of 12% and 13% respectively). For retail funding (net percentage of 5%), the deterioration in access remained stable compared with the previous quarter and reflects the continued increase in bank deposit rates and shifts towards more highly remunerated types of saving. Access deteriorated for short-term deposits, while it remained broadly unchanged for longer-term deposits (net percentages of 9% and 1% respectively), which is in line with outflows from overnight deposits and shifts into term deposits owing to the stronger interest rate increases for term deposits.

In the second quarter of 2023 euro area banks expect, on balance, a similar deterioration of their access to money markets and debt securities funding (net percentages of 5% and 11% respectively). Along the same line, a somewhat higher net percentage of banks expects a further deterioration in their access to retail funds compared with the first quarter (net percentage of 8%).
3.2 The impact of the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio[7]
3.2.1 Impact of the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio on banks’ financial situation
Euro area banks reported, in net terms, that the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio had a negative impact on their financing conditions over the last six months (see Chart 16). Banks reported a larger negative impact on their market financing conditions (net percentage of -16%, after -10%) and liquidity position (net percentage of -7%, after -5%), compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, the impact on banks’ profitability turned broadly neutral (net percentage of 1%, after -2%; see Chart 17), of which the impact via capital losses remained negative. These developments reflect the end of the ECB’s net asset purchases since July 2022 and the switch from full to partial reinvestment of redemptions since the beginning of March 2023. The impact on banks’ total assets was negative, after a positive impact in the previous quarter (net percentage of -4%, after 4%). This is in line with the now negative impact of changes in the ECB’s asset portfolio on lending volumes, which was positive before (see Section 3.2.2 below), as well as the decrease in central bank liquidity.

Exploration of potential solutions for central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions recorded on distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms
New market contact group to foster dialogue and information exchange with industry
The Eurosystem is to look into how wholesale financial transactions recorded on DLT platforms could be settled in central bank money. The purpose of this initiative is to (i) consolidate and further develop the ongoing work of Eurosystem central banks in this area, and (ii) gain insight into how different solutions could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and DLT platforms.
A dedicated market contact group will be set up to support the Eurosystem’s exploratory work. This group will provide expert input and keep the Eurosystem abreast of advances in the use of DLT and other new technologies in wholesale financial markets.
The work is part of the Eurosystem’s broader efforts to ensure that developments in central bank money keep pace with and contribute to digital innovation in wholesale and retail payments, and that central bank money remains a monetary anchor that supports the stability, integration and efficiency of the European financial system and payments system.

Euro money market activity dominated by secured and foreign exchange swap segments
Turnover in secured and unsecured segments concentrated in very short-term tenors
Largest share of trades in secured segment cleared by central counterparties, while non-banks were most active counterparty in unsecured segment
Effective transmission of ECB policy rates to unsecured money market rates
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its Euro money market study 2022, which shows that daily aggregate turnover in the euro money market had grown by 23% to €1.3 trillion at the end of 2022, up from €1 trillion at the end of 2020. During 2021 and 2022 activity increased in all five segments under review: secured (+7%), unsecured (+40%), short-term securities (+51%), foreign exchange swaps (+35%) and overnight index swaps (+159%). It was also largely concentrated in the secured and foreign exchange swap segments, with the former accounting for more than half of the total turnover.
The study also reveals that activity in the unsecured and secured money market segments was highly concentrated in the very short-term tenors (overnight, spot/next and tomorrow/next). Non-bank counterparties were involved in 80% of the unsecured money market trades, while 70% of the trades in the secured segment were cleared by central counterparties. Compared with the period 2019-20, the footprint of non-bank counterparties and central counterparties in the unsecured and secured segments respectively therefore remained broadly similar.
The study finds that changes in the ECB’s policy rates in 2022 were immediately and completely reflected in money market rates in the unsecured segment, while their transmission to rates in the secured segment was less uniform across euro area jurisdictions and partially lagged.

Digital euro potentially available initially to euro area residents, merchants and governments
Digital euro could be made available via existing banking apps and Eurosystem app
Offline and person-to-person payments across euro area seen as highly valued
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published the third progress report on the digital euro, as well as the findings of focus groups commissioned by the ECB concerning people’s views on the features of a potential digital wallet.
The progress report presents a third set of design and distribution options, endorsed by the ECB’s Governing Council, that would feed into the overall design of a digital euro. In its initial releases, a digital euro would be accessible to euro area residents, merchants and governments. Non-resident euro area citizens might also have access, provided that they held an account with a euro area-based payment services provider (PSP). In further releases, consumers from selected third countries could also have access, depending on accessibility rules to be set out in the legislative framework for a digital euro. The report also anticipates the potential provision of cross-currency functionalities with other central bank digital currencies outside the euro area.
The Governing Council also proposes that a digital euro could be distributed via PSPs, as defined in the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). A digital euro could be made available to euro area residents via existing banking apps or via an app provided by the Eurosystem offering a harmonised entry point for basic payment functionalities provided by PSPs. Supervised intermediaries – e.g. banks distributing digital euro – would be required to provide a set of mandatory core services to end-users and could offer additional services. These could include conditional payments or the ability to split person-to-person payments among multiple parties.
The report also indicates that the design of the digital euro would be adjusted, as needed, to comply with the legal framework to be adopted by European co-legislators.
The ECB has today also published the findings of a commissioned study using focus groups to evaluate people’s views on specific features of a potential digital wallet. The study found that most participants were interested in trying some of the digital wallet features presented. The concrete findings are relevant to the design features of a possible digital euro.
The study shows that person-to-person money transfers – available throughout the euro area – are considered an essential feature for a digital wallet. Offline payments, which are currently not widely available, are deemed a useful feature when, for example, someone has limited connectivity. Participants also valued budget management tools and conditional payments, including payment on delivery and pay-per-use.
This qualitative study, based on data from focus groups and in-depth interviews, was conducted in all euro area countries from December 2022 to January 2023. Participants included (i) members of the general public, (ii) people with knowledge of technology, (iii) small and larger merchants and retailers, and (iv) individuals with limited access to banking services or the internet.
“We value the views and needs of our fellow Europeans very highly. We listen to them. The digital euro project is for the people of Europe”, said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “The Eurosystem is committed to ensuring a digital euro would be fit for purpose in a digital economy. The findings from these reports will feed into our decision on the future of the project, which will be taken in the autumn.”

,"Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 24 April 2023
I am pleased to appear before this Committee again today as part of our series of hearings on the digital euro project.
We are now entering the final stage of the investigation phase of the project. The ECB’s Governing Council recently endorsed a third set of design options for the digital euro – design options that we have also discussed in previous hearings. Today we are thus publishing a report setting out the Eurosystem’s views on how people could access, hold and start to use the digital euro. The report also examines how the digital euro could be distributed by intermediaries as well as the services and features it could offer.
[
1
]
Our work in recent months has not just been about investigating technical issues. We have also held focus groups to hear from potential users of a digital euro and find out what they think about the different features a digital wallet should have. This will help us in designing a product that meets their needs.
[
2
]
In a modern economy, being able to pay digitally is a basic need for people.
With cash, central banks already provide a means of payment that is risk-free, widely accessible and easy to use, and that leaves no-one behind. But the rapid digitalisation of our economies requires us to complement cash with its evolution in the digital sphere: a digital euro.
As a central bank, we need to be ready for future evolutions and make sure that the money we issue maintains its role as a monetary anchor in the digital era, thereby reassuring us that one euro is one euro whatever form it takes and wherever we go. And it cements people’s trust in our currency.
[
3
]
For this monetary anchor to be effective, the digital euro would need to be in line with people’s preferences. Everyone across the euro area should be able to use it for day-to-day payments: online, in shops or from person to person.
In my remarks today, I will focus on how we can ensure that everyone in the euro area would be able to easily access and use a digital euro – if and when they want to, no matter who they bank with or which country they come from. People would have no obligation to use the digital euro. But they should always have the option to use it. Just like they do with cash today.
You, as European legislators, will take decisions that will be key to us achieving this objective. Therefore, in my remarks I will look at the digital euro also from a regulatory angle.
Ensuring the digital euro is widely available and easy to use
There is currently no single European digital means of payment that is universally accepted across the entire euro area. It therefore comes as no surprise that Europeans see the ability to pay anywhere as the most important feature of a potential digital euro.
[
4
]
In other words, they are keen for one of the key characteristics of euro banknotes to be replicated in the digital realm.
At the ECB, we have been investigating the technical solutions that would enable people to easily make payments in digital euro, anywhere in the euro area.
[
5
]
But if we want the digital euro to replicate these cash-like features, we need a proper regulatory framework.
Legislators assigned the legal tender status to euro banknotes in the Treaty
[
6
]
, and this is why citizens can use them throughout the entire euro area.
[
7
]
They are tangible proof that we share a single currency.
The digital euro could also be given legal tender status by legislators.
[
8
]
If introduced, the digital euro would be a public good, and Europeans would expect to be able to access and use it easily, anywhere in the euro area. So, it would be more beneficial and convenient for all users if merchants that accept digital payments were obliged to accept the digital euro as legal tender.
[
9
]
A requirement for merchants to accept digital euro could, in fact, also be seen as an opportunity. For example, it would make European payments more resilient and would enhance competition.
[
10
]
This, in turn, would help to make payments cheaper, with clear benefits for everyone in the euro area.
[
11
]
But if we want to make the digital euro widely usable, acceptance is only one side of the coin. The other side is access.
Individuals and merchants will expect to be able to obtain digital euro at their banks
[
12
]
, just like they do today with cash.
[
13
]
It should be simple for people to start using the digital euro, and there should be no need to change bank in order to do so.
In our regular exchanges, consumer associations and merchants
[
14
]
have remarked that the best way to ensure broad access for consumers would be to require euro area banks and other payment service providers to make the digital euro available to their customers.
[
15
]
Previous attempts at building pan-European payment initiatives have shown that ensuring broad access throughout the euro area has ultimately always required regulatory measures.
[
16
]
So, both sides of the coin – widespread acceptance and broad access – are necessary to ensuring the digital euro would be a public good that meets the expectations of consumers and merchants.
These two aspects are also key to achieve other public policy goals. For instance, they are essential to ensure that the digital euro can support financial inclusion and generate opportunities for financial intermediaries.
A digital euro would offer a new platform for innovation that is truly European. It would allow these intermediaries to build services for their customers that are instantly available across Europe. It could help domestic payment providers and new instant payment solutions to scale up and operate at the European level. And it would reduce dependence on a few dominant providers, increasing competition and resilience.
Ensuring a seamless European payment experience
Over the past 20 years euro banknotes have enabled everyone in the euro area to easily recognise and use public money, regardless of what country they are living in, or where they are paying.
The same should be true for the digital euro. People should be able to pay and be paid in digital euro anywhere in the euro area, no matter which intermediary they are using to access the digital euro or which country they are in.
To achieve this, we need a common set of standards – which we call a “payment scheme”.
[
17
]
The scope of these standards will be limited to what is strictly necessary to establish and offer users a harmonised and convenient payment experience, while enabling and inviting the supervised intermediaries to develop further services and solutions.
[
18
]
Even if supervised intermediaries will distribute the digital euro, one should not forget that it will be a liability of the central bank. The Eurosystem, as its issuer, would be accountable to euro area citizens for its correspondence to their payment needs. The Eurosystem should therefore be able to govern the standards to ensure that using a digital euro in the future is as standardised as using cash today. It would do so by steering consensus among all involved stakeholders – consumers, retailers, banks and non-banks.
Ensuring wide availability through the right economic incentives
Economic incentives should be used to encourage the active distribution of the digital euro and to ensure that it is widely available. We have already proposed a set of four core principles for a digital euro compensation model.
[
19
]
You asked for more details on these principles in previous hearings, so I will share our thoughts on them now. Ultimately, however, the decision on the regulatory framework for fees is primarily a matter for you, as European legislators.
The first principle is that, as a public good, the digital euro should serve society. We believe consumers should be able to use it free of charge for basic day-to-day purposes.
[
20
]
Second, intermediaries should be compensated for the services they provide, just like they are for other digital payments.
Third, legislative safeguards should prevent merchants from being overcharged by intermediaries if they are obliged to accept digital euro as legal tender. While we believe that the digital euro would allow for more competitive fees, this principle would ensure that fees for merchants cannot exceed the current levels for comparable means of payment.
Finally, the Eurosystem would bear its own costs, for example for settlement
[
21
]
activities and managing the common standards for making and receiving payments in digital euro. This would reflect the public good nature of the digital euro and follow the same logic that currently applies to cash. The savings that arise from the Eurosystem covering its own costs would ultimately benefit the end-users.
The path ahead
Let me conclude.
The design of the digital euro and its regulatory framework are key to ensuring that it retains its key characteristics as a public good.
It will then be European legislators to decide whether the digital euro will be an inclusive, truly European means of payment – widely usable and accessible across the entire euro area, free for basic use, and offering the highest levels of privacy. The success of a digital euro will be in your hands.
The ECB stands ready to continue discussing all these issues with you during the legislative process. Throughout the next project phase, which is expected to be launched later this year, we will accommodate any necessary adjustments to the design of the digital euro that may emerge from legislative deliberations.
[
22
]
In that phase, we will develop and test the possible technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro.
These two processes – legislative and design – should advance in parallel so we can be in a position to promptly begin issuing a digital euro, if and when warranted. The possible decision by the Governing Council to issue a digital euro would be taken only after the legislative act has been adopted.
We will take all the necessary measures to ensure that the digital euro would act as a true public good. But all European institutions have to play their part to achieve our common goal of making the digital euro a success. This is why we are looking forward to the European Commission’s legislative proposal. It will be a decisive step forward for the digital euro and put Europe at the forefront of the work on central bank digital currencies among the G7.
I now look forward to your questions."

Only one-quarter of EU climate-related catastrophe losses currently insured; gap expected to widen as impact of climate change grows
Insurance gap poses risks to economy and financial stability
ECB and EIOPA outline policy options to promote climate catastrophe insurance
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) today published a joint discussion paper on how to better insure households and businesses in the European Union against climate-related natural catastrophes such as floods or wildfires. The policy options set out in the paper are aimed at boosting the uptake and efficiency of climate catastrophe insurance while creating incentives to adapt to and reduce climate risks.
“We need to increase the uptake of climate catastrophe insurance to limit the growing impact of natural disasters on the economy and the financial system,” said ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos. “However, to reduce losses in the first place, we must ensure that a smooth and speedy green transition is complemented by effective measures to adapt to climate change.”
EIOPA Chairperson Petra Hielkema added: “Insurance plays a major role in protecting businesses and people against climate-related catastrophe losses by swiftly providing the necessary funds for reconstruction. In order to efficiently protect our society, we need to address the concern of the increasing insurance protection gap by proposing and finding appropriate solutions.”
Currently, only about one-quarter of all climate-related catastrophe losses in the European Union are insured. In some countries, the figure is below 5%. This is partly because many people underestimate the costs of climate-related damage. Some also shy away from insurance, preferring to rely on government support. As natural disasters become both more frequent and more severe, insurance costs are expected to rise. Some insurers may reduce risk coverage or stop providing certain types of catastrophe insurance altogether, which would widen the insurance gap further.
The lack of climate catastrophe insurance can affect the economy and financial stability. If losses are not covered by insurance, the speed at which households and firms can resume their activities is reduced, slowing economic recovery. Lasting supply chain disruptions can also lead to spillovers from one firm to another and affect firms’ ability to pay back loans, thereby increasing banks’ exposures to credit risk. Additionally, the financial position of governments may be weakened if they need to provide relief to cover uninsured losses.
To foster insurance coverage, the ECB and EIOPA suggest that insurers should design their policies to encourage households and firms to reduce risk, for example by granting discounts for implementing effective mitigation or adaptation measures. To support the overall supply of insurance, the use of catastrophe bonds could be increased to pass on part of the risk to capital market investors. In the same vein, governments could set up public-private partnerships and backstops to partly cover the costs that insurers may incur in the event of major disasters. To protect themselves and ensure that public funds are used efficiently, governments should also provide strong incentives to reduce risks. Finally, national-level insurance schemes could be complemented by an EU-wide public scheme that makes sure sufficient funds are made available to European countries for reconstruction following rare, large-scale climate-related catastrophes.
The joint discussion paper is part of the ECB’s climate agenda and, more broadly, its work to improve understanding of climate-related risk. The paper aims to foster debate on how to tackle the climate insurance protection gap. The ECB and EIOPA will collect feedback on the policy options and also discuss them in a workshop with regulators, policymakers, insurers and academics on 22 May 2023.

24 new banks to be added on 1 July 2024 to the 47 banks currently reporting to the Money Market Statistics Reporting (MMSR)
Data from these new banks to be included in the euro short-term rate (€STR) at a later stage to continue providing a robust and reliable benchmark
The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to expand the reporting population for Money Market Statistics Reporting (MMSR) by adding 24 new banks to the 47 banks currently reporting. The new MMSR reporting banks will start reporting on 1 July 2024, contributing to a higher representativeness of the MMSR data published by the ECB. At the same time the ECB has reviewed the current MMSR reporting population and decided to remove one bank from the reporting population. The ECB, as administrator of the euro short-term rate (€STR), has also decided that the inclusion of the MMSR data from the new reporting agents in the calculation of the €STR will take place at a later stage to ensure that the newly reported data is of sufficiently good quality. The increase in the reporting population will further support the robustness and reliability of the benchmark.

ECB and SRB ready to provide technical input on proposals to ensure consistent and workable framework
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Single Resolution Board (SRB) welcome the European Commission’s proposed legislative changes to the European bank crisis management and deposit insurance framework.
“Over the past ten years, Europe has already made significant progress in establishing a robust framework for dealing with banks in financial difficulties and bank failures. Taking this a step further is something we very much welcome,” said Luis de Guindos and Andrea Enria, respectively Vice-President and Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB. “The legislative proposals will enable the authorities to manage bank crises in a more efficient and harmonised way and are therefore an important step towards completing the banking union.”
“The proposals contain many positive developments. For example, they clarify the scope of application of a resolution in relation to national liquidation procedures. They also enhance our toolkit for managing bank failures in a way that protects critical functions and citizens effectively,” said Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the SRB. “Going forward, it will be key to make sure – throughout the legislative process – that the different parts of the framework continue to form a coherent whole.”
The ECB and the SRB took part in the consultation process that led to the European Commission’s proposals and published related documents, such as the ECB contribution and the SRB contribution. Both institutions stand ready to provide technical input to further enhance the Commission’s proposals and ensure that the overall framework is consistent and workable.
The ECB notes that the European Commission has recommended that the European Parliament and the EU Council consult the ECB on the proposed legislative changes. Following requests for consultation, the ECB would deliver its opinion in due course.

Credit terms and conditions tightened for all counterparty types over December 2022 to February 2023 review period and year to March
Maximum amount and maximum maturity of funding offered against euro-denominated government bonds increased over review period
Initial margin requirements for most non-centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives increased over review period
The March 2023 Survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets (SESFOD) marks the tenth anniversary of this survey. The three-monthly SESFOD is an important input into the ECB’s financial stability and market functioning analyses such as the Financial Stability Review.
On balance, overall credit terms and conditions tightened slightly over the December 2022 to February 2023 review period for all counterparty types. Price and non-price terms tightened for all counterparty types except sovereigns, and in particular for banks and dealers. The overall tightening of credit terms and conditions was mainly attributed to a deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning. It continued the trend reported for the previous seven quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the December 2022 survey. Survey respondents expect overall credit terms to tighten further over the period from March to May 2023. The practices of central counterparties, including margin requirements and haircuts, contributed slightly to the tightening of survey respondents’ price and non-price terms. The amount of resources dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures increased in the December 2022 to February 2023 review period, continuing developments reported since the March 2022 survey round. The use of financial leverage decreased for investment funds and insurance companies over the review period. Hedge funds intensified efforts to negotiate more favourable terms.

Note: Net percentage is defined as the difference between the percentage of respondents reporting “tightened somewhat” or “tightened considerably” and the percentage reporting “eased somewhat” or “eased considerably”.
In the case of securities financing transactions, a significant share of respondents reported that the maximum amount and maximum maturity of funding offered against euro-denominated securities had increased for most collateral types, but in particular for government bonds. Survey respondents also reported larger haircuts being applied to high-yield corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and covered bonds, while financing rates/spreads had increased for financing secured against all collateral types, in some cases significantly. In addition, they reported higher overall demand for funding, in particular funding with a maturity greater than 30 days. Liquidity had continued to deteriorate for all collateral types, in particular for high-yield corporate bonds, government bonds and financial corporate bonds.
Turning to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, survey respondents reported that initial margin requirements for most of these types of derivative had increased in the December 2022 to February 2023 review period. They reported an increase in the maximum amount of exposure for certain types of credit derivative, although a decrease was reported for commodity derivatives. Respondents reported an unchanged maximum maturity of trades for all types of derivative. Liquidity and trading improved somewhat for foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives but deteriorated for most other types of non-centrally cleared derivative.
The ECB included special questions in the March 2023 survey to look into the longer-term trend. The survey asked respondents to compare credit terms and conditions at the cut-off date of the March 2023 survey round (i.e. end of February 2023) with those reported in the March 2022 round. Compared with the previous year, overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had tightened for all counterparty types.
The March 2023 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The March 2023 survey collected qualitative information on changes between December 2022 and February 2023. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Compared with January 2023:
consumer inflation expectations declined further;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months edged down slightly, while expectations for nominal spending growth edged up;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers’ expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months declined further to 8.7% in February 2023, from 9.5% in January. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months continued to decline, moving down from 4.9% in January to 4.6%. Expectations for inflation three years ahead edged down from 2.5% to 2.4%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the horizon of three years. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead was unchanged, remaining broadly in line with the elevated levels observed since March 2022. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.2% over the next 12 months, down from 1.3% in January. The small decline reflects the lower expectations of consumers in households with median or below-median incomes. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months rose to 6.6%, from 6.3% in January. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months rose slightly to 3.9%, from 3.8% in January. This slight increase was mainly driven by older respondents (aged 55-70). (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
While still pointing to a contraction, economic growth expectations for the next 12 months continued to increase, rising to -0.9% from -1.2% in January 2023. In line with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead declined to 11.5%, compared with 11.6% in January. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.1%). The lowest income quintile reported the highest expected and perceived unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to increase slightly to 2.6%, compared with 2.5% in January. This increase mainly reflects higher expectations of respondents below the age of 55, while older respondents expected a further deceleration in the growth of the price of their home. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead rose slightly to 5.0%, standing 1.7 percentage points above the expectations recorded at the start of 2022. At the same time, perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both improved slightly compared with January.

Share of women at top (senior and mid-management) and entry (analyst) levels in line with interim targets
Initiatives to attract female talent include flexible working, scholarship, mentoring and development programmes for women
Gender strategy is part of the ECB’s broader diversity and inclusion efforts
The European Central Bank (ECB) has achieved its interim gender targets for managers, which is particularly important for creating role models and mentoring. It has narrowed the gap at the expert (salary band F/G) and the team lead (H) levels and is making further efforts to increase hiring and promotion for these two categories. At the analyst level (E/F), the share of women has continued to grow in line with the ECB’s goals, which helps to extend the pool of eligible women for further career steps.
Chart 1

Gender targets are part of the ECB’s wider diversity and inclusion (D&I) policy to promote other aspects of diversity such as race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, nationality and disability, with the support of six D&I networks.
“A diverse and inclusive organisation reflects the world around us,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “It shows the intellectual courage to embrace the values of different perspectives, backgrounds and identities that will enrich debate and lead us to more robust decisions in all areas,” she added.
At the ECB, one parent is eligible for 20 weeks of paid maternity/adoption leave. In 2022 the ECB increased paid special leave for the other parent to 20 days from 10 days to promote greater balance in family responsibilities. It published nationality figures for its staff and management to increase transparency about a key diversity facet. The ECB initiated and co-signed the ESCB and SSM equality, diversity and inclusion charter together with 26 national central banks and supervisors in the European Union.
The next assessment will be based on data for 2024.

First climate-related disclosures show Eurosystem corporate sector portfolios and ECB non-monetary policy portfolios on decarbonisation path
Disclosures reflect Eurosystem-wide effort to boost transparency
Eurosystem to disclose climate-related information on additional portfolios
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its first climate-related financial disclosures, which provide information on its portfolios’ carbon footprint and exposure to climate risks, as well as on climate-related governance, strategy and risk management.
Presented in two reports, the disclosures cover the Eurosystem’s corporate security holdings under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as well as the ECB’s euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios (NMPPs), including its own funds portfolio and its staff pension fund.
“These disclosures are a further piece of the puzzle in our efforts to contribute to fighting climate change,” says President Christine Lagarde. “They give us a clear view of our progress in decarbonising our portfolios and, over time, they will help us to chart the most effective course towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.”
The disclosures show that the corporate bonds held under the CSPP and PEPP are on a decarbonisation path. Although the portfolios’ absolute greenhouse gas emissions have increased in recent years because the Eurosystem has purchased more securities for monetary policy purposes, issuers’ carbon intensity has gradually declined. This is partly due to the fact that the companies in our portfolio have lowered their emissions for every million euro of revenue they earn, reflecting their efforts to significantly reduce their emissions and boost carbon efficiency.
A second factor reducing the relative emissions associated with corporate sector purchases since October 2022 is the ECB’s decision to tilt its holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance, which is helping to decarbonise the Eurosystem’s corporate sector portfolios on a path in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The disclosures also show that the ECB has more than halved emissions from corporate and equity investments in its staff pension fund since 2019. These assets are already aligned with the Paris Agreement and low-carbon benchmarks, which has resulted in the reallocation of funds towards more carbon-efficient issuers, putting the portfolio on a firm decarbonisation path. For its own funds portfolio, the ECB has gradually increased the share of green bonds, up from 1% in 2019 to 13% in 2022. As this portfolio consists mainly of euro area government bonds, its decarbonisation depends to a large extent on countries’ efforts to reduce their emissions and meet Paris Agreement goals.
From now on, the ECB will disclose climate-related information on these portfolios every year, while continuously improving the disclosures as the quality and availability of data progress. Over time, it will expand the scope of the disclosures to cover other monetary policy portfolios, such as those under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and other assets under the PEPP. The ECB also aims to set interim decarbonisation targets for its own funds portfolio and staff pension fund to stay on track with Paris Agreement goals. Similarly, the ECB Governing Council will consider setting such targets for corporate sector portfolios.
The ECB’s NMPP disclosures are part of a concerted effort by all Eurosystem central banks to publish climate-related financial disclosures on their euro-denominated NMPPs using a common framework that defines minimum reporting requirements based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. A dedicated ECB page will list the disclosures of all Eurosystem central banks as they are published over the coming weeks.
By publishing these disclosures, the Eurosystem is delivering on one of the key commitments outlined in its climate change action plan. Looking ahead, the ECB will regularly review its climate-related measures to ensure, within its mandate, that it continues to support a decarbonisation path in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and EU climate neutrality objectives.

Notes
Euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios (NMPPs) contain the assets held by Eurosystem central banks that are not related to monetary policy operations. They include euro-denominated investment portfolios and staff pension funds that are managed by the national central banks, which have sole responsibility for their NMPPs and climate-related financial disclosures.
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures was created by the Financial Stability Board to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information, by developing recommendations on the types of information that companies should disclose."

Eurosystem’s new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and central liquidity management tool went live on 20 March 2023
New consolidated payment system successfully completed first day of operations
Upgraded system to contribute to harmonisation and efficiency of Europe’s financial markets
The Eurosystem has successfully launched the new T2 wholesale payment system, which comprises an RTGS system and a central liquidity management tool. Migration to the new system took place between 17 and 20 March 2023. T2 has replaced TARGET2 as the new RTGS system for settling payments related to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations, as well as bank-to-bank and commercial transactions. TARGET2 processed payments worth €2.2 trillion per day on average. The first day of T2 operations went smoothly despite a delayed closure, the root cause of which was identified and fixed. The new RTGS system settled around 400,000 transactions, broadly in line with the average volume experienced before the migration.
The software and the environment for the new system were delivered by the Banca d’Italia, the Banco de España, the Banque de France and the Deutsche Bundesbank – the four national central banks that act as service providers for TARGET services (T2, TARGET2-Securities and TIPS). All Eurosystem central banks have supported their national communities throughout this project, and the successful launch reflects the commitment and efforts of all parties.
This project was initiated in December 2017 with the aim of harmonising and integrating TARGET services for the benefit of Europe’s financial markets and improving cost efficiency. The new system offers enhanced cyber resilience and optimises the use of liquidity, as participants are able to steer, manage and monitor liquidity in central bank money across all TARGET services. Harmonisation is achieved through a move to the ISO 20022 message standard, as well as a set of common components that are shared across TARGET services, bringing further cost savings for participants. Technical changes were made to TARGET2-Securities in July 2022 in preparation for the launch of the new T2 wholesale payment system, which brings the consolidation project to an end.
This project is part of the Eurosystem’s continued efforts to modernise market infrastructure, ensuring that it is future-proof and meets the needs and expectations of market participants, and further improving the efficiency of Europe’s financial markets.

ECB and other major central banks to offer 7-day US dollar operations on a daily basis
New frequency effective as of 20 March 2023 to remain in place at least through the end of April to support smooth functioning of US dollar funding markets
The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing a coordinated action to enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements.
To improve the swap lines’ effectiveness in providing US dollar funding, the central banks currently offering US dollar operations have agreed to increase the frequency of 7-day maturity operations from weekly to daily. These daily operations will commence on Monday, 20 March 2023, and will continue at least through the end of April.
The network of swap lines among these central banks is a set of available standing facilities and serves as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses.

Inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. Therefore, the Governing Council today decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with its determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions, which will be determined by its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council is monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, the ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections were finalised in early March before the recent emergence of financial market tensions. As such, these tensions imply additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of inflation and growth. Prior to these latest developments, the baseline path for headline inflation had already been revised down, mainly owing to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected. ECB staff now see inflation averaging 5.3% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food continued to increase in February and ECB staff expect it to average 4.6% in 2023, which is higher than foreseen in the December projections. Subsequently, it is projected to come down to 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, as the upward pressures from past supply shocks and the reopening of the economy fade out and as tighter monetary policy increasingly dampens demand.
The baseline projections for growth in 2023 have been revised up to an average of 1.0% as a result of both the decline in energy prices and the economy’s greater resilience to the challenging international environment. ECB staff then expect growth to pick up further, to 1.6%, in both 2024 and 2025, underpinned by a robust labour market, improving confidence and a recovery in real incomes. At the same time, the pick-up in growth in 2024 and 2025 is weaker than projected in December, owing to the tightening of monetary policy.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 3.50%, 3.75% and 3.00% respectively, with effect from 22 March 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem does not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. The ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."
,"Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 15-16 March 2023
20 April 2023
1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel distinguished two periods when reporting on financial market developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 1-2 February 2023.
In the first period, stretching until the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the United States, mounting signs of more persistent pressures on core inflation in the euro area – i.e. inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) excluding the food and energy components – had led investors to reassess their views on the likely future path of inflation and interest rates, and they were pricing in a higher-for-longer inflation and rate environment. Expectations regarding the level of the “terminal rate” (the peak rate) in the ECB’s ongoing rate hiking cycle had reached a level of 4.2% in the week prior to the Governing Council’s meeting on 15-16 March, while the expected date of the first rate cut had been pushed out to the third quarter of 2024. Yet, despite this sharp upward revision to the expected policy rate path, market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations had continued to point to elevated concerns that inflation would remain above the ECB’s target of 2%.
The second period had started when these market developments had been abruptly halted by the collapse of SVB. Interest rate expectations had been revised downwards sharply, but they had partially reversed this decline on 14 March 2023 before dropping again on the morning of 15 March. Financial market indicators at the close of the markets on 14 March 2023 had not shown signs that the US banking sector turbulence would cause a systemic crisis in the United States or the euro area. However, the moves in these indicators had reversed again on the morning of 15 March, in turbulent market conditions. It would not be possible to get a clearer picture of the most recent change in market perceptions until the dust from the market turbulence had settled.
Amid this market volatility, three observations stood out. First, broad stock indices had remained much more resilient than bank stocks, as the share prices of non-financial corporations had been affected only moderately. Second, spillovers from the United States to the euro area had been contained. Third, bank share prices in the euro area remained well in positive territory relative to their lows in mid-2022, owing to the strong and sustained rally since then on the back of improving earnings expectations.
While stock prices of major global banks had fallen sharply across Europe and the United States, spreads on credit default swaps had increased only moderately for euro area banks. Liquidity conditions also remained solid. The FRA-OIS spread – i.e. the difference between the rate charged on interbank unsecured deposits and the overnight index swap (OIS) rate – had increased significantly in the euro area but had remained near its long-term average level. Moreover, the cost of offshore US dollar funding had increased substantially, although this increase had been partially reversed subsequently. As regards volatility, fixed income markets had reacted much more strongly to the SVB event than equity markets. Overall, these developments suggested that, if there was no intensification of the stress in the banking sector, the inflation outlook would soon come to the fore again in the minds of market participants.
Before the banking sector turbulence had started in the United States, global macroeconomic upside surprises had dominated financial market developments across major economies. Positive data on economic activity had been accompanied by upward surprises for headline inflation and, especially, core inflation in the euro area. This growth and inflation mix had led to a repricing by markets of the inflation outlook for the euro area over the medium term, as market participants perceived the factors driving inflation pressures to have shifted from external supply to internal demand or, put differently, from headline to core inflation. Investors were now pricing in a substantially more sluggish return of inflation to 2%, despite lower natural gas prices.
Expectations of more persistent core inflation had led to a significant reappraisal of policy rate expectations in the euro area. The United States had seen a similarly strong repricing of the forward curve, underlining the perceived close synchronicity in the global economic activity and inflation cycle. These developments had been reversed after the unfolding of the events related to SVB. But developments in market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area were a vivid reminder that investors saw elevated risks of inflation remaining above target in the medium term. Evidence from option prices also pointed to elevated upside risks to inflation.
Three factors had fuelled market concerns about inflation becoming more persistent in the euro area. The first related to the prevailing uncertainty about the ECB’s “reaction function”. The second factor was related to uncertainty about the extent of policy tightening needed to bring real interest rates into sufficiently restrictive territory to curb inflation. The third factor related to broader financial conditions, which might be insufficiently restrictive, as they had remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s October monetary policy meeting despite a notable tightening of monetary policy in this period.
Regarding developments in bond markets, sovereign bond spreads had remained broadly unchanged until the collapse of SVB, when they had started to increase somewhat. Yet this increase in spreads had been moderate and entirely driven by the sharper decline in German Bund yields. Developments in corporate bond markets had also been benign until the onset of the banking sector stress. Since then, there had been a sharp increase in corporate bond spreads of investment-grade financial corporations compared with those of non-financial corporations. Spreads of high-yield non-financial corporate bonds had also increased, but they remained at relatively compressed levels from a historical perspective.
Regarding market functioning, collateral availability concerns had been fading. Since the announcement of the new ceiling for remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits, the spread between short-term government bills and the respective risk-free rates (OIS) had been narrowing. Looking ahead, further progress on the roll-off of the ECB’s monetary policy bond portfolios would support the availability of collateral.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Mr Lane noted that the ongoing exceptional tensions in the financial markets were a source of significant uncertainty for the economic outlook. These could lead to an undue tightening of credit conditions or significantly dampen confidence, and therefore implied additional uncertainty for the baseline assessments of growth and inflation.
The Governing Council needed to closely monitor current market tensions and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector was resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. This reflected effective supervision and a rigorous implementation of the global regulatory reform agenda. In any case, the ECB’s policy toolkit was fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
Turning to economic developments in the euro area, a series of favourable supply shocks and increasing evidence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening working its way through the economy had been the dominant developments since the start of the year. The fall in energy prices and the clearing of supply chain bottlenecks were lowering price pressures, while at the same time boosting confidence and supporting real incomes and business activity, especially in the short run. Indeed, most survey indicators pointed to improving business and consumer sentiment, although still at low levels, with the brighter prospects for economic activity reflecting a broad-based improvement in supply conditions. Delivery times for inputs for factories were shortening to a degree not seen since the recovery from the global financial crisis in 2009. However, international markets were becoming a drag on the euro area economy, as evidenced by the substantial fall in order book volumes in February.
Overall, the world economy showed signs of a stabilisation in the first few months of the year and the reopening in China was expected to provide support later on. Nevertheless, the outlook for global activity remained subdued in the near term, reflecting weak domestic demand in key trading partners of the euro area. In addition, the rapid tightening of the ECB’s monetary policy stance was increasing the cost of credit for the euro area economy and slowing the provision of bank loans. This sharp tightening of financing conditions was starting to affect the real economy measurably.
Euro area economic activity had stagnated in the last quarter of 2022. Industrial production was virtually flat in the final quarter of 2002 and had recovered only marginally in January 2023. Notable contractions in the production of energy, intermediate goods and durable consumer goods had been offset by still expanding production of non-durable and capital goods, especially motor vehicles, as production in these sectors was recovering with the easing of supply disruptions. At the same time, market services had contracted in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly because of sharp declines in retail trade, transport, and accommodation and food services in December. While the previously expected economic contraction had been avoided, all private domestic demand components had contracted.
Whereas private consumption had been very strong in the second and third quarters of 2022 as a result of the reopening of the euro area economy, the significant drop in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflected low confidence and the earlier terms-of-trade shock adversely affecting spending decisions. Looking ahead, households had started to be more optimistic in their expectations for their own financial situation, thanks to the decline in inflation. However, this had not yet translated into stronger optimism in their spending plans. In relation to demand for housing, where monetary policy was expected to have a stronger impact, the results of the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey showed that households’ perceptions of housing as a good investment continued to deteriorate.
Turning to investment, investment in residential construction had started to fall in the second quarter of 2022 and this decline had accelerated in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. Survey indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for output and business expectations in the construction sector, had recovered slightly in recent months but still clearly pointed to contracting activity both currently and in the near future. Business investment had seen a small contraction in the last quarter of 2022 if Irish intellectual property products were excluded. Survey indicators showed some improvement in the capital goods sector in recent months, as the output PMI for the sector had moved into slightly positive territory, in line with the expected better outlook for GDP in the short term. But steeply rising financing costs were expected to weigh on business investment in the quarters ahead.
For trade, recent data confirmed a significant drop in imports of goods, while exports had recovered somewhat. Thanks to falling energy prices, the terms of trade had started to improve at the end of last year and this had led to an improvement in the goods trade balance. On the services side, forward-looking indicators for tourism pointed to the expectation of a strong rebound in the first half of 2023, to which the reopening of China might also contribute.
Regarding the labour market, all indicators pointed to resilience. The unemployment rate had stood at 6.6% in January, broadly stable since April 2022. The vacancy rate had also remained stable. Employment growth was expected to remain positive in early 2023, according to the PMI. The labour force had recovered from the impact of the pandemic and remained well above its longer-term trend. This dynamism reflected increased participation rates – in particular for older workers – and an increase in migrant workers. This was an important element to take into account in relation to future wage growth dynamics.
These macroeconomic developments were reflected in the March 2023 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Provided that the current financial market tensions did not feed into an undue tightening of credit conditions or significantly dampen confidence, the economy looked set to recover over the coming quarters as the adverse supply shocks that had occurred over the past few years had been partly reversed. Industrial production was expected to pick up as supply conditions improved further, confidence continued to recover, and firms worked off large order backlogs. Rising wages and falling energy prices would partly offset the loss of purchasing power that many households were experiencing as a result of high inflation. This, in turn, was projected to support consumer spending. Accordingly, projected growth for 2023 had been revised up by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.0%, in the March staff projections. At the same time, the expected further pick-up in growth to 1.6% in both 2024 and 2025 was weaker than projected in December, as the headwinds from tighter financing conditions and the appreciation of the euro were seen to outweigh the positive effects on real income and confidence of somewhat lower inflation. This combination of factors, together with the gradual withdrawal of fiscal support and lingering concerns about energy supply risks for the winter of 2023-24, was expected to weigh on economic growth in the medium term.
Risks to the outlook for economic growth were tilted to the downside. Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected. However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment and, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currently expected.
Inflation had edged down from 8.6% in January to 8.5% in February, while underlying price pressures remained strong. The decline in the overall inflation index had resulted from a renewed sharp drop in energy prices. Conversely, food price inflation had increased further, to 15.0% in February, with the past surge in the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production still feeding through to consumer prices. Inflation excluding energy and food had increased markedly to 5.6% in February, from 5.3% in January, driven by the delayed pass-through of the past surge in energy prices, as well as continued, albeit declining, pipeline pressures and strengthening wage growth pressures. At the sectoral level, inflation in the non-energy industrial goods sector had risen to 6.8% in February, mainly reflecting the delayed effects of past supply bottlenecks and high energy prices. Services inflation – which had risen to 4.8% in February – was also still being driven by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases, residual pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and rising wages.
Other indicators of underlying inflation had also stayed high. As these indicators aimed to capture the most persistent part of inflation, it was interesting to compare them with the surveys of expectations about the persistence of inflation. Survey data on expectations of headline inflation in the near term were aligned with the information coming from the indicators of underlying inflation. In other words, the surveys predicted that inflation would fall but remain high, at above 4%, over the next few months. However, for 2024-25 there was a disconnect, as both survey data and market-based inflation compensation measures indicated that inflation would be well below 4% from the beginning of 2024. This showed that it was not straightforward to extrapolate a signal for medium-term headline inflation from indicators of underlying inflation. Indeed, it was likely that these indicators reflected, to varying degrees, cumulated distortions as a result of extraordinary developments following the pandemic – namely the war in Ukraine and the energy shock.
Focusing on core inflation, there had been a large gap between the inflation developments in energy-sensitive sectors and those in non-energy-sensitive sectors. Those sectors with a high energy dependency had seen a disproportionate increase in the inflation rate compared with non-energy-sensitive sectors. This implied that, as the effect of the energy shock faded, the contribution of this component of core inflation would start to decline. Mr Lane also noted that, while downward pressures could be expected from inflation developments in energy-sensitive sectors, inflation in wage-intensive sectors had started to increase their contribution to core inflation.
Changes in HICP weights in January were expected to have a significant impact on the profile of inflation in 2023. For headline inflation the change implied a negative impact throughout 2023, while for core inflation (and especially services) the impact was estimated to be negative in the first quarter of 2023 and positive in the third quarter of the year, mostly owing to a higher weight of recreational services in 2023.
Mr Lane remarked that it was important to look also at the inflation momentum in order to capture turning points. One indicator for momentum was the three-month-on-three-month annualised inflation rate based on seasonally adjusted data. For headline inflation this measure had fallen from close to 11% in November 2022 to close to 3% in February 2023. This sharp fall in momentum was entirely due to a sharp decline in energy inflation. For other components of the HICP, changes in inflation momentum were much more limited.
Although pipeline pressures were weakening, they remained substantial. Wage pressures had strengthened, supported by robust labour markets and employees aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation. Moreover, many firms had been able to raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand. The evolution of profits compared with that of wages suggested that wages had had only a limited influence on inflation over the past two years and that the increase in profits had been significantly more dynamic than that in wages. An important question for the forecasting of inflation was whether firms would continue with the same pricing strategy or would accept lower profit margins in the period ahead.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased substantially across maturities since the Governing Council’s 1-2 February meeting, although they had eased again more recently. More reassuringly, expectations captured in the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts and the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters showed that an increasing share of respondents expected inflation to be at target over the long run. Household expectations for inflation three years ahead, as expressed in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, had declined by 0.5 percentage points in January 2023 compared with the previous month’s survey.
In the March ECB staff projections, the path for inflation had been revised down throughout the projection horizon, owing mainly to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected. This, in turn, implied a smaller role for compensatory fiscal measures and a somewhat stronger impact of monetary policy tightening. Inflation was now projected to average 5.3% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025, implying downward revisions of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.2 percentage points respectively.
In contrast, inflation excluding energy and food had been revised up by 0.4 percentage points to 4.6% for 2023, largely on account of recent data surprises and the lagged pass-through of indirect effects from past energy price increases. Overall, these indirect effects would still contribute to inflation until the end of the projection horizon despite the sharp downward corrections in energy prices. Similarly, the past depreciation of the euro had continued to put upward pressure on core inflation, although to a lesser extent than previously assumed owing to the recent appreciation of the euro. So, while most of the projected core inflation was essentially coming from profits and labour costs, the contribution of indirect effects from the past energy shock and depreciation of the euro was still sizeable. However, the fall in energy prices, combined with the recent appreciation of the euro and continued tightening of credit conditions, was expected to gradually dampen core inflation compared with the December projections. This was reflected in the downward revisions to core inflation of 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024 and 2025 respectively. Over those later years of the projection horizon, core inflation was projected to ease slowly towards 2% by 2025.
Upside risks to inflation included existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices even higher in the near term. Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the Governing Council’s target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. On the downside, persistently elevated financial market tensions could accelerate disinflation. In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlying inflation and wages. A weakening of demand, including owing to a stronger than expected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.
Financing conditions reflected a strong transmission of tighter monetary policy but had recently been subject to significant volatility. Market interest rates had risen considerably in the weeks following the Governing Council’s February monetary policy meeting. But this increase had reversed sharply in the days before the March meeting in the context of severe financial market tensions. Turning to real rates, Mr Lane commented on two measures of the real rate. The first was the short-term version, computed as the policy rate minus the expected inflation rate one quarter ahead. This short-term real rate remained negative, but it was increasing strongly – into positive territory – as expected inflation was declining and the policy rate implied by the yield curve was increasing. The second version was a medium-term cost of finance concept, computed as the expected average policy rate over the next year minus the expected inflation rate over the same period. This second version was solidly positive throughout the horizon.
Mr Lane emphasised that bank credit to firms had become more expensive and, in January, banks’ cost of borrowing had risen to levels last seen in late 2011. The biggest increase was in bank bond yields, but deposit rates were also starting to rise noticeably. There was also a composition effect because more people were moving away from overnight deposits to better remunerated types of deposits. Moreover, the move away from targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) to market funding was also pushing up the cost of finance for banks. Following a sharp slowdown since mid-2022, credit flows to non-financial firms had lately declined to close to zero as a result of lower demand and considerably tighter credit supply conditions.
The cost of borrowing for households had increased as well, especially owing to higher mortgage rates, which were currently at their highest level since early 2013. This rise in borrowing costs and the resultant decline in demand, along with tighter credit standards, had led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans to households. Amid these weaker loan dynamics, money growth had again slowed sharply, driven by its most liquid components. The decline in the annual growth rate of narrow money (M1) had been accelerated by a pronounced reshuffling between instruments within broad money (M3), with shifts from overnight deposits into other less liquid but better remunerated instruments, such as time deposits.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
Since inflation was set to remain above the target for too long, Mr Lane proposed raising the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with the intention communicated after the February Governing Council meeting. The Governing Council should also state that future policy rate decisions would be determined by its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Following up on the announcement in February that the Governing Council would evaluate the subsequent path of its monetary policy at the March meeting, this clear statement of the ECB’s policy reaction function would help orient market expectations towards the key factors underlying its decisions. In particular, this would clarify that a careful analysis of underlying price pressures and the state of monetary policy transmission at each point in time would act as a cross-check of the staff projections in times of heightened uncertainty and potential structural change. It also reflected the fact that monetary policy considered financial developments to the extent that these affected price stability, in line with the ECB’s monetary policy strategy statement.
As regards the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the signalling power of the PEPP’s reinvestment flexibility framework still contributed to supporting the transmission mechanism. It was therefore proposed that, in the spirit of prudence, the Governing Council should continue to allow flexibility in PEPP reinvestments as an effective first line of defence against remaining fragmentation risks, but that it would only exercise this flexibility in the event market conditions deteriorated.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly shared the assessment of the economic situation and outlook of the euro area provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. The March ECB staff projections had a cut-off date in mid-February for the technical assumptions and had been finalised in early March. This was before the release of the flash estimate of euro area inflation for February and the emergence of financial market tensions. There was broad agreement that these tensions implied additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of economic growth and inflation. The view was expressed that, given the emergence of the tensions and heightened uncertainty, observers might see the economy as being in a different place compared with that pictured in the projections. At the same time, the point was made that despite the uncertainty implied by the tensions, and unless the situation deteriorated drastically in the new situation, inflation would still not simply disappear on its own and underlying inflation, in particular, remained far too high.
As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that the upward impact on trade from the unwinding of supply bottlenecks had been fading in the second half of 2022. In the March ECB staff projections, both world real GDP growth and trade growth had been revised upwards for 2023, reflecting higher growth projections for China and the United States. In the exchange of views, it was reiterated that the reopening of the Chinese economy would increase China’s appetite for commodities. While currently this applied mostly to China’s demand for coal, it was suggested that the prospect of the country restocking gas supplies should be closely monitored, as increased demand for gas might not yet be fully reflected in current gas futures prices and could still have an impact on euro area energy prices. It was pointed out that even slower than expected growth in China would still imply an enormous increase in its energy demand.
Turning to economic activity in the euro area, members took note of Mr Lane’s assessment that the dominant developments since the start of the year represented a partial reversal of earlier adverse supply shocks and there was increasing evidence that monetary policy tightening was starting to work its way through the economy. The euro area economy had stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2022, thus avoiding the previously expected contraction. However, private domestic demand had fallen sharply as high inflation, prevailing uncertainties and tighter financing conditions had dented private consumption and investment. These had fallen by 0.9% and 3.6% respectively. According to the March ECB staff projections, the economy looked set to recover over the coming quarters. Industrial production should pick up as supply conditions improved further, confidence continued to recover and firms worked off large order backlogs. Rising wages and falling energy prices would attenuate the loss of purchasing power that many households were experiencing as a result of high inflation. This, in turn, would support consumer spending.
Looking ahead, the ECB staff’s baseline projections for economic growth in 2023 had been revised up to an average of 1.0%. This was the result of both the decline in energy prices and the economy’s greater resilience to the challenging international environment. The projections then expected growth to pick up further, to 1.6%, in both 2024 and 2025, underpinned by a robust labour market, improving confidence and a recovery in real incomes. At the same time, the pick-up in growth in 2024 and 2025 was seen to be weaker than projected in December, owing to the tightening of monetary policy. Some comfort was drawn from the fact that there had been no contraction at the end of last year, which had previously been expected, but it was cautioned that the observed stagnation still implied a fragile growth outlook for this year.
It was noted that the upward revision to economic growth in 2023 reflected a better than expected outcome for the fourth quarter of 2022 and lower energy prices. At the same time, financing conditions were now substantially tighter compared with the corresponding assumptions underpinning the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections. It was well understood that the impact of interest rate increases on growth usually came with a lag, but there was still a question as to whether forecasting models sufficiently captured the cumulative impact on growth and inflation of the sequence of rate increases seen so far. It was also argued that the decline in the credit-to-GDP ratio foreseen over the projection horizon could not be driven only by a fall in demand for credit but had to reflect also significant supply-side effects. These were likely to have a strong impact on consumption and investment, which appeared at odds with the only limited credit supply effects on GDP incorporated into the staff projections. At the same time, it was questioned whether, in the absence of hard evidence, quantity restrictions on lending should have come into play at all, at least before the recent turbulence, since the economy had improved and macro risks had receded, while bank profitability had been growing and capital and liquidity positions were solid.
Members widely underlined the continued resilience of the labour market, which had remained strong despite the weakening of economic activity. Employment had grown by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.6% in January 2023. It was noted that the increase in the unemployment rate that had been expected for the last six months had not materialised and that the projections implied continued labour market tightness over the projection horizon. Strong growth in employment was seen as reflecting the elastic response of the labour force to job opportunities, which differed from the situation in the United Kingdom and the United States, where labour force participation rates had not fully recovered since the pandemic. At the same time, it was cautioned that the upward revisions to real GDP growth and highly resilient labour markets likely reflected the impact of some tailwinds, including accumulated savings and liquidity buffers held by households and firms, as well as generous government support measures, all of which could not be expected to last indefinitely. In this context, it was recalled that labour markets were usually a lagging indicator that sooner or later might reflect the uncertainties in the real economy. However, it was also argued that the tight labour market might reflect potentially persistent matching problems between vacancies and the unemployed, which would also have implications for wages. The point was made that the resilience of the labour market and labour scarcity likely meant that, on the basis of historical regularities, the monetary policy transmission to the economy could well be weaker than was expected.
As regards fiscal policies, members reiterated that government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. As energy prices were falling and risks around the energy supply were receding, it was important to start rolling back these measures promptly and in a concerted manner. Measures falling short of these principles were likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU’s economic governance framework and as stated in the European Commission’s guidance of 8 March 2023, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the euro area economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly. Risks on the fiscal side were seen as stemming from governments’ energy-related support measures remaining in place for longer than currently expected or budgetary space being redirected towards other expenditures, with uncertainty prevailing about the reform of the EU’s fiscal governance framework and the outlook for medium-term national consolidation paths.
Against this background, members overall assessed risks to the economic growth outlook as tilted to the downside. Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. It was pointed out in this regard that the recent financial market tensions could put the current expectation of a soft landing of the economy at risk. Russia’s war against Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected. However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment and, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currently expected. For the medium term, the question was raised as to whether the assessment that the balance of risks was tilted to the downside was justified, given that the baseline projections had already seen a substantial downward adjustment.
With regard to price developments, looking ahead, members noted that the path for headline inflation had been revised down in the March ECB staff projections, mainly owing to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected and a somewhat stronger downward impact from monetary policy tightening. At the same time, underlying price pressures remained strong and ECB staff expected HICP inflation excluding energy and food to average 4.6% in 2023, which was higher than foreseen in the December projections.
In the discussion of the inflation outlook and the projections, the point was made that HICP data for February had surprised on the upside compared with the starting point for the projections. Mechanically incorporating the latest information would imply higher headline and core inflation in 2023. Moreover, even disregarding this upside surprise, the projected outcome of 4.6% for core inflation in 2023 suggested that the projections incorporated an overly optimistic belief in the unwinding of underlying inflation. While core inflation might be close to a turning point, this had not yet been seen in hard data. Reference was made to the calculations of the momentum of core inflation in the short term, based on annualising the rate of price increases over the last three months, which had rebounded for the euro area according to the February inflation data release.
Some comfort was drawn, however, from the observation that the March projection had embodied the first downward revision to the inflation outlook after eight consecutive rounds of upward revisions. It was acknowledged that this was mainly due to lower current and future energy commodity prices and implied that the supply shock that had caused inflation to surge initially was now partly unwinding. Questions were raised as to how strongly and quickly the new situation of energy prices would be reflected in underlying inflation. While it was welcomed that the projections incorporated some staggered effects in the pass-through of past increases in energy prices to core inflation, this begged the question of whether the pass-through would play out symmetrically with respect to the recent declines in energy prices. As evidence for an asymmetric pass-through, it was observed that PMI survey data pointed to a much slower decline in output prices than in input prices, which was in line with recent academic research.
It was remarked that the decomposition of HICP inflation excluding energy and food into energy-sensitive and wage-sensitive items suggested that, while the energy factor was becoming less important, wages were becoming more important. According to this decomposition, wage growth was becoming the main driver of underlying inflation and lately its contribution had been roughly twice as large as in 2019-20. The apparent stickiness of core inflation thus reflected a rotation of the main drivers.
It was also argued that the extent to which the adjustment of core inflation to energy price developments was symmetric over the disinflationary phase would depend on the behaviour of profit margins. It was recalled that profit margins had remained rather resilient and had even expanded during 2022, in the face of the large adverse energy and cost-push shocks. This behaviour might potentially differ when energy prices fell, but it remained to be seen if the widening of profit margins would reverse in 2023.
As regards wage and price-setting, members agreed that wage pressures had strengthened on the back of robust labour markets and employees aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation. Moreover, many firms had been able to raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand. Reference was made to the strong growth in compensation per employee and unit labour costs in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was well above levels considered consistent with the 2% inflation target in the medium term. Given the tight labour markets and the ongoing high inflationary pressures, in particular for everyday purchases such as food, wage growth was not expected to ease soon. It was observed that the average for wage agreements in the euro area concealed considerable variation across countries.
There were doubts about whether the projected lower wage growth towards the end of the horizon in the March projections was justified. At the same time, it was argued that it was consistent to revise down nominal wage growth if inflation decelerated at a faster pace than previously expected over the medium term. Nominal wage growth was a little lower because of the fall in the cost of living. In real terms, however, the projections implied an upward revision of wages, and it was noted that this now implied that the terms-of-trade shock would not result in any decline in real wages by the end of the projection horizon compared with early 2022.
Members widely reiterated that developments in profits and mark-ups warranted constant monitoring and further analysis on an equal footing with developments in wages. Frequent references to wages in public communication did not imply that there was no consideration of profit margin developments. It was stressed that the terms-of-trade shock had been operating like a tax and that its absorption in the domestic economy should proceed with some burden-sharing between labour and capital. From a monetary policy perspective, what mattered was that burden-sharing would contribute to preventing second-round effects and wage-price spirals. The question was also raised as to whether the strong profit margin developments implied that the sizeable cost pressures had not immediately affected the competitiveness of European exporters. It was observed that corporate balance sheets and profitability had been very strong, which suggested that pricing power had been significant until the economy had started to soften. In a period of increasing cost pressures, this pricing power and an increased frequency of price changes had kept upward pressure on underlying inflation. However, the point was also made that competitiveness concerns would ultimately kick in and help reduce inflation.
As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note that most measures currently stood at around 2%, although they warranted continued monitoring, especially in light of recent volatility in market-based inflation expectations. It was underlined that market-derived inflation expectations had increased substantially across maturities in the period between the Governing Council’s last two monetary policy meetings, although they had eased again more recently. While these measures seemed to include significant inflation risk premia, a rise in these premia could be interpreted as reflecting market uncertainty about the ECB’s ability to achieve its inflation target on a lasting basis. The fact that the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had moved up to almost 2.6% was seen as an indication that a fast reduction in underlying inflation was unlikely. Furthermore, market-based inflation expectations had hardly moved down in response to the latest financial market tensions, suggesting that the events were not seen as having a large disinflationary impact.
However, it was also recalled that swap rates did not reflect genuine inflation expectations, as they included significant inflation risk premia. Reference was also made to the recent increase in option price-implied probabilities of longer-term inflation being above 3%. With respect to surveys, it was recalled that medium-term inflation expectations in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey had, reassuringly, been coming down.
Against this background, members assessed that there were both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook and that, in view of the considerable uncertainty associated with the recent financial market tensions, there was no need for the Governing Council to express its own collective balance of risks to price stability from the range of risk factors. The upside risks to inflation included existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices even higher than expected in the near term. Domestic factors, such as inflation expectations persistently above target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. The downside risks to inflation included persistently elevated financial market tensions that could accelerate disinflation. In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlying inflation and wages. A weakening of demand, including owing to a sharper deceleration of bank credit or a stronger than projected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term. Listing these risk factors did not imply that the risks were balanced but instead highlighted the significant uncertainty that prevailed in the current environment, which called for a data-dependent approach to monetary policymaking.
In their discussion, members expressed a range of views on the risks with respect to the baseline of the staff inflation projections, with a number of members seeing risks as tilted to the upside over the entire horizon. Some members argued that there was only a small probability that inflation would fall back to low levels as quickly as suggested in the March ECB staff projections, which gave the impression of an “immaculate disinflation” (i.e. a return of inflation to target with very low cost in terms of lost output). It was also underlined that the baseline and the balance of risks were not independent of one another: if the downward revision to the baseline reflected greater optimism, this should lead to an upward tilting of the risk balance. It was remarked that such an interpretation appeared to be corroborated by the latest inflation data, which had been higher than expected and challenged the downward revision of the baseline. In addition, it was suggested that the latest strengthening of wage growth was consistent with second-round effects having already started. It was also suggested that the output gap was now narrower than before and that, in any case, it gave different indications compared with the unemployment gap, as had been discussed on previous occasions. The point was made that there was a potential for different risk factors to reinforce rather than neutralise each other, and this would then imply greater persistence, especially of core inflation, than was embedded in the projections. More expansionary fiscal policy was considered to be a further important upside risk factor, although it was surrounded by uncertainty, related not least to adherence to fiscal rules. At the same time, it was argued that the downward impacts incorporated in the baseline from monetary policy tightening and credit constraints were too small, which implied a downside risk.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members widely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. It was noted that bank credit to euro area firms had become more expensive, among other things because collateral values were declining. This was also contributing to a sharp contraction in demand for loans. At the same time, credit supply was also playing a role, with the recent tensions in financial markets likely to reinforce the tightening of credit conditions and banks becoming more sensitive to the risk of deposit outflows and therefore less willing to lend. However, against the background of an economy projected to pick up over the coming quarters and profitable lending opportunities for banks, the existence of credit supply restrictions was called into question. Moreover, the argument was made that credit developments, and specifically bank lending to firms, responded to monetary policy with a time lag. Hence the recent weakening in loan growth could reflect lower credit demand owing to the energy price shock and high investment uncertainty rather than quantitative restrictions on the supply of credit. Reference was also made to the downward trend in lending to non-financial corporations reversing some of the exceptionally strong loan growth seen during the pandemic period. It was cautioned, however, that such a benign assessment might have to be revised if risk premia increased and the tensions in financial markets proved to be longer-lasting.
It was noted that household borrowing had also become more expensive, owing to higher mortgage rates. These had resulted in a decline in loan demand and, along with tighter credit standards, had led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans to households. Concerns were voiced that the sharp slowdown in money growth, which was driven by its most liquid components, could foreshadow further risks to the economic outlook.
At the same time, members expressed confidence that the euro area banking sector was resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. The Governing Council’s expression of confidence in the euro area banking sector, together with the measures that were being discussed at the international level to ease conditions for banks’ foreign currency funding, were expected to alleviate the current market tensions. The view was held that, should it be faced with spillovers to euro area banks, the Governing Council was equipped with a policy toolkit that allowed it to provide sufficient liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy. With these instruments, the Governing Council was seen as being able to calm markets if and when necessary.
The point was made that, in the context of tighter monetary policy, pockets of financial vulnerability had to be expected. It was also to be expected that market participants would scrutinise the soundness of banks, so elevated market volatility was likely to persist. It was argued that, in assessing financial stability risks, it had to be considered that the transmission of monetary policy impulses was likely to be stronger at times of market stress than in calmer times.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members widely agreed that bank credit had become more expensive since the previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting an ongoing transmission of tighter monetary policy. However, bond markets and broader financial conditions had more recently been subject to significant volatility, with increasing risk premia but lower risk-free yields, as market participants had considerably lowered their expectations for the policy rate peak in the current hiking cycle. This was exerting countervailing effects and was likely to mean that more time was needed to fully assess the overall effect of the monetary policy stance on financial conditions.
Against this background, reference was made to the separation principle, which called for the monetary policy stance to be assessed independently of risks related to financial stability. It was recalled that the Governing Council had liquidity instruments at hand to address potential liquidity strains in the banking sector and spillovers from international developments, which allowed it to look through the recent volatility in financial market variables to set interest rates in accordance with its price stability objective. Further analysis on the strength of monetary policy transmission was seen as warranted, so as to better understand the effect of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook and on trends in underlying inflation. On the one hand, the view was held that in the past the effect of monetary policy had been continually overestimated, which might happen again. On the other hand, it was pointed out that, because of long transmission lags, the effects of the interest rate increases since July 2022 had not yet fully materialised, leading to a risk that the impact of monetary policy tightening was being underestimated.
Turning to the policy proposal for the present meeting, members emphasised that inflation remained far too high and was projected to remain too high for too long. While inflation expectations appeared to remain broadly anchored, developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation had been moving in the wrong direction for much of the period since the February monetary policy meeting, and there was a risk that high inflation could become more persistent, with core inflation still increasing. In this context, monetary policy still had some way to go to bring inflation down, including in the case that the baseline of the March ECB staff projections materialised. The point was made that, in light of the risk of persistent inflation dynamics, the ECB’s monetary policy had to be persistent as well.
At the same time, the ongoing exceptional financial market tensions were seen as a source of significant uncertainty for the economic and inflation outlook, as the magnitude, persistence and scope of the shock were not known. Sustained financial stress had the potential to move the economy from the baseline scenario to a different regime, with such a regime shift being difficult to ascertain in real time. All in all, it was felt that the two objectives of price stability and financial stability were complementary and there was no fundamental trade-off, as safeguarding financial stability supported an orderly transmission of monetary policy and the achievement of price stability over the medium term. Moreover, it was judged that, unless the situation deteriorated significantly, the financial market tensions were unlikely to fundamentally change the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Against this background, a very large majority agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the ECB’s key interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with the intention the Governing Council had communicated at its last monetary policy meeting. It was acknowledged that in the current situation of heightened uncertainty a decision had to be taken with imperfect information. In this situation, risks were seen on both sides. However, following the announced intended interest rate path was seen as important to instil confidence and avoid creating further uncertainty in financial markets. In any case, it was highlighted that inflation was far above the Governing Council’s target and inflation dynamics were still too strong, which justified a 50 basis point increase in the ECB’s key interest rates. Overall, delivering a 50 basis point increase was considered to be proportionate, taking into account possible side effects.
Some members would have preferred not to increase the key rates until the financial market tensions had subsided and to conduct a comprehensive re-evaluation of the stance at the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting, in May. It was stressed that markets were volatile and the positive opening of the financial markets on the second day of the current meeting could not be taken as evidence that financial stability risks had receded. Moreover, a risk-management approach was seen as calling for the interest rate hike to be put on hold, as the risks from not raising rates, if the tensions turned out to be short-lived, were assessed to be much less severe than the risks associated with raising rates into a persistent crisis. Moreover, a 50 basis point increase would exert a much stronger tightening effect if the economy was already suffering from the fallout of financial stress. Past episodes were recalled in which the Governing Council had increased interest rates and then had to reverse the hike shortly afterwards. It was felt that the Governing Council’s data-dependent approach would in the current situation suggest postponing the interest rate hike and waiting until uncertainty had declined.
Looking ahead, members concurred with Mr Lane that the elevated level of uncertainty reinforced the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions. It was argued that this approach would acknowledge the Governing Council’s limited information as to how the ongoing market turbulence was likely to develop. At the same time, it was maintained that the Governing Council’s communication would confirm its determination to deliver on its primary objective, underpinned with a sizeable interest rate increase at the present meeting.
Against this background, it was underlined that if the inflation outlook embedded in the March ECB staff projections were confirmed, the Governing Council would have further ground to cover in adjusting the monetary policy stance to ensure a timely return of inflation to target.
At the same time, it was also seen as important for the Governing Council to clarify its reaction function for future monetary policy decisions. In this context, spelling out the main “reaction variables” was critical. In particular, these comprised the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. By listing the main variables that would be given particular weight in upcoming policy decisions, the Governing Council would provide an anchor that the public could use to form expectations in conditions of heightened uncertainty. A clearer statement of the policy reaction function would allow the public to form their own assessment of the strength of monetary policy transmission, on the basis of newly available information such as from the bank lending survey. In any case, the Governing Council would have time in the period until its monetary policy meeting in May to reassess the effect of the tightening in financing conditions on inflation dynamics. At the same time, it would stand ready to provide liquidity support if needed to ensure a smooth monetary policy transmission.
With these considerations in mind, members generally agreed that the Governing Council should refrain from communicating unconditional expectations for the future interest rate path. However, the concern was voiced that the absence of any such guidance could be interpreted as indicating that the hiking cycle was coming to an end. For this reason, it was suggested to convey the message that, had the recent market turmoil not occurred, the Governing Council would have expressed the expectation that it would increase rates further, given the baseline scenario.
All in all, members widely concurred on the resilience of the euro area banking system and on the importance of reassuring market participants that banks’ capital and liquidity positions were strong. The view was held that, while it should be indicated that the Governing Council would monitor financial stability risks, it had to be reiterated that price stability was the primary objective and that the Governing Council remained committed to bringing inflation back to its medium-term target in a timely manner.
Finally, it was seen as important to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target and – in view of the elevated uncertainty – to also highlight the smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio. Maintaining the existing flexibility in PEPP reinvestments was considered an efficient, pre-emptive approach to responding to a potential re-emergence of risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

Release of the next monetary policy account foreseen on 1 June 2023."
7 March 2023,"7 March 2023
Compared with December 2022:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months and three years ahead declined;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months continued to rise, while expectations for nominal spending growth declined further;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers’ expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months weakened, while those for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained unchanged.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months declined to 9.5% in January 2023, from 9.9% in December 2022. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months edged down to 4.9% from 5.0%, while median expectations for inflation three years ahead declined significantly to 2.5%, from 3.0% in the previous month. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the horizon of three years. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead edged up but remained broadly in line with the elevated levels observed since March 2022. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.3% over the next 12 months, up from 1.0% in December. This improvement was primarily driven by respondents with household incomes below the median. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months were roughly stable at 6.3%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months moderated significantly to 3.8%, from 4.2% in the previous month. This decline was mainly driven by older respondents (aged 55-70). (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
While still pointing to a contraction, economic growth expectations for the next 12 months continued to shift upwards to stand at -1.2%, from -1.5% in December 2022. In line with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead declined to 11.6%, compared with 11.9% in December. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.3%). Quarterly data showed that, in January 2023, respondents who were unemployed reported a marginal increase in their expected probability of finding a job over the next three months, which rose to 28.1%, from 27.9% in October 2022. Employed respondents reported that the expected probability of job loss over the next three months lessened more significantly, falling to 8.1% in January, from 9.2% in October 2022. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to weaken to 2.5%, compared with 3.0% in December 2022. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained broadly stable at 4.9%, which is 1.6 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months remained unchanged overall, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months improved slightly. The share of consumers who reported having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined to 13.6% in January, from 13.9% in October 2022. (Housing and credit access results)
The next release of the Consumer Expectations Survey results is scheduled for 4 April 2023.

ECB profit zero in 2022 (2021: €0.2 billion) after release of €1.6 billion from provision for financial risks
No profit distribution to euro area national central banks
The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) audited financial statements for 2022 show that the ECB’s profit was zero (2021: €192 million) and thus there will be no profit distribution to the euro area national central banks (NCBs). This result takes into account a release of €1,627 million from the provision for financial risks to cover losses incurred during the year. These losses mainly arose from the interest expense resulting from the ECB’s net TARGET2 liability and security write-downs in the own funds and US dollar portfolios. After the release, the provision for financial risks declined to €6,566 million.
Net interest income totalled €900 million in 2022 (2021: €1,566 million). The main driver of the decrease compared to the previous year was the interest expense resulting from the ECB’s net TARGET2 liability, which amounted to €2,075 million (2021: €22 million interest income). Interest income earned on the ECB’s share of total euro banknotes in circulation and interest expense paid to the NCBs as remuneration of their claims in respect of foreign reserves transferred to the ECB amounted to €736 million and €201 million respectively (2021: zero for both). These changes resulted from increases in the interest rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to levels above 0% since 27 July 2022. Net interest income from securities held for monetary policy purposes increased to €1,534 million (2021: €1,006 million), while net interest income on foreign reserve assets increased to €798 million (2021: €197 million). These increases resulted mainly from higher euro area and US yields respectively.
Write-downs amounted to €1,840 million (2021: €133 million), mainly stemming from unrealised price losses on securities held in the own funds and US dollar portfolios owing to increased bond yields.
Impairment tests were conducted on the securities held by the ECB in its monetary policy portfolios, which are valued at amortised cost (subject to impairment). Based on the results of these tests, no impairment losses were recorded for these portfolios.
Total staff costs decreased to €652 million (2021: €674 million), mainly as a result of actuarial valuation gains relating to other long-term benefits. Other administrative expenses increased to €572 million (2021: €564 million), mainly because of a gradual return to normal levels of activity following the pandemic and the ongoing development and improvement of banking supervision-related IT systems.
Supervisory fee income, derived from fees charged to recover expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its supervisory tasks, amounted to €594 million (2021: €578 million).
The total size of the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €19 billion to €699 billion (2021: €680 billion). This increase was mainly due to securities purchased under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the asset purchase programme (APP).
The ECB’s total paid-up capital increased by €0.6 billion to €8.9 billion after the payment of the second instalment by the euro area NCBs of their increased subscriptions as a result of the Bank of England’s withdrawal from the European System of Central Banks on 31 January 2020 in connection with the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.
Consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem
At the end of 2022 the size of the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem, which comprises assets and liabilities of the euro area NCBs and the ECB vis-à-vis third parties, stood at €7,956 billion (2021: €8,564 billion). The reduction compared to the previous year was mainly due to the decrease in Eurosystem lending operations as a result of early repayments and maturing of amounts borrowed in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), which was partially offset by higher holdings of monetary policy securities as a result of purchases under the APP and the PEPP.
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes rose by €224 billion to €4,937 billion (2021: €4,713 billion). APP holdings increased by €130 billion to €3,254 billion and PEPP holdings increased by €100 billion to €1,681 billion.

]
is an integral part of the ECB’s Annual Accounts and is designed to provide readers with contextual information related to the financial statements.
[
2
]
Given that the ECB’s activities and operations are undertaken in support of its policy objectives, the ECB’s financial position and result should be viewed in conjunction with its policy actions.
To this end, the management report presents the ECB’s main tasks and activities, as well as their impact on its financial statements. Furthermore, it analyses the main developments in the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account during the year and includes information on the ECB’s financial resources. Finally, it describes the risk environment in which the ECB operates, providing information on the specific risks to which the ECB is exposed, and the risk management policies used to mitigate risks.
1.2 Main tasks and activities
The ECB is part of the Eurosystem, which comprises, besides the ECB, the national central banks (NCBs) of the Member States of the European Union (EU) whose currency is the euro.
[

1.3 Financial developments
1.3.1 Balance Sheet
The ECB’s Balance Sheet expanded significantly in the period from 2018 to 2022, mainly driven by outright purchases of securities by the ECB in the context of the implementation of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem (Chart 1). As net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP)
[
6
]
ceased in December 2018 and resumed again in November 2019, growth was moderate in 2019 and stemmed mainly from rises in the market value of the ECB’s foreign reserve assets and the value of euro banknotes in circulation. The main drivers of the substantial expansion in 2020 and 2021 were net purchases of securities under the APP and the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
[
7
]
in March 2020. Net purchases of securities under the PEPP and APP were discontinued as of the end of March 2022 and 1 July 2022 respectively, leading to a more moderate increase in the ECB’s Balance Sheet in 2022.
Chart 1
Main components of the ECB’s Balance Sheet
(EUR billions)
Source: ECB.
In 2022 the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €18.7 billion to €698.9 billion, mainly owing to the ECB’s share of securities purchases under the PEPP and the APP. These purchases resulted in an increase in securities held for monetary policy purposes, while the cash settlement of these purchases via TARGET2 accounts led to a corresponding rise in intra-Eurosystem liabilities. This rise in intra-Eurosystem liabilities was more than offset by cash inflows as a result of higher deposits placed with the ECB by euro area residents, which simultaneously resulted in an increase in other liabilities.
The rise in the euro equivalent value of the ECB’s foreign reserve assets and in the value of euro banknotes in circulation also contributed to the growth of the ECB’s Balance Sheet.
Euro-denominated securities held for monetary policy purposes made up 65% of the ECB’s total assets at the end of 2022. Under this balance sheet item, the ECB holds securities acquired in the context of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the CBPP3, the ABSPP, the PSPP and the PEPP. All remaining securities held under the first and the second covered bond purchase programmes (CBPP1 and CBPP2) matured during 2022.
Based on the relevant Governing Council decisions, the ECB continued its net purchases of securities under the PEPP until the end of March 2022, while net purchases under the APP ended as of 1 July 2022. At the same time, the principal payments from maturing securities held in both portfolios continued to be fully reinvested during the year. As a result of these purchases and reinvestments, the portfolio of securities held by the ECB for monetary policy purposes rose by €11.9 billion to €457.3 billion (Chart 2), with PEPP and PSPP holdings increasing by €9.0 billion and €8.8 billion respectively. The €5.5 billion decrease in ABSPP holdings was due to redemptions.
In December 2022 the Governing Council announced
[
8
]
that, from the beginning of March 2023, the APP portfolio would decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023, and its subsequent pace will be determined over time. The Governing Council will continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024 and will continue applying flexibility across time, asset classes and jurisdictions in these reinvestments with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

In 2022 the total euro equivalent value of the ECB’s foreign reserve assets, which consist of gold, special drawing rights, US dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi, increased by €4.1 billion to €84.5 billion.
The euro equivalent value of the ECB’s holdings of gold and gold receivables increased by €1.6 billion to €27.7 billion in 2022 (Chart 4) owing to an increase in the market price of gold in euro terms, while the size of these holdings in fine ounces remained unchanged. This increase also led to an equivalent rise in the ECB’s gold revaluation accounts (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”).

The ECB’s foreign currency holdings
[

]
of US dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi increased in euro terms by €2.0 billion to €55.0 billion (Chart 5), mainly owing to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro. The appreciation of the US dollar is also reflected in higher balances in the ECB’s revaluation accounts (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”).
Chart 5
Foreign currency holdings

The US dollar continued to be the main component of the ECB’s foreign currency holdings, accounting for approximately 78% of the total at the end of 2022.
The ECB manages the investment of its foreign currency holdings using a three-step approach. First, a strategic benchmark portfolio is designed by the ECB’s risk managers and approved by the Governing Council. Second, the ECB’s portfolio managers design the tactical benchmark portfolio, which is approved by the Executive Board. Third, investment operations are conducted in a decentralised manner by the NCBs on a day-to-day basis.
The ECB’s foreign currency holdings are mainly invested in securities and money market deposits or are held in current accounts (Chart 6). Securities in this portfolio are valued at year-end market prices.

Composition of foreign currency investments

The purpose of the ECB’s foreign currency holdings is to finance potential interventions in the foreign exchange market. For this reason, the ECB’s foreign currency holdings are managed in accordance with three objectives (in order of priority): liquidity, safety and return. Therefore, this portfolio mainly comprises securities with short maturities (Chart 7).

Maturity profile of foreign currency-denominated securities

The value of the own funds portfolio remained virtually unchanged at €21.1 billion (Chart 8) as its main drivers in 2022 were largely mutually offsetting. The investment of a total amount equal to the amount transferred to the ECB’s provision for financial risks in 2021 and the amount paid up by the euro area NCBs in 2022 in respect of the second instalment of their increased subscriptions in the ECB’s capital following the withdrawal of the Bank of England from the ESCB (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”) increased the size of the own funds portfolio. However, this increase was almost fully offset by the decline in the market value of the securities held in this portfolio as a result of the significant rise in euro area bond yields (Chart 16).
Chart 8
The ECB’s own funds portfolio

The portfolio mainly consists of euro-denominated securities which are valued at year-end market prices. In 2022 government debt securities accounted for 76% of the total portfolio.
The share of green investments in the own funds portfolio continued to increase, rising from 7.6% at the end of 2021 to 13.1% at the end of 2022. The ECB plans to further increase this share over the coming years.

Since 2021 purchases of green bonds in secondary markets are complemented by investments in the euro-denominated green bond investment fund for central banks launched by the Bank for International Settlements in January 2021.
The ECB’s own funds portfolio predominantly consists of investments of the ECB’s financial resources, namely its paid-up capital and amounts set aside in the general reserve fund and in the provision for financial risks. The purpose of this portfolio is to provide income to help fund the ECB’s operating expenses which are not related to the delivery of its supervisory tasks.

It is invested in euro-denominated assets, subject to the limits imposed by its risk control framework. This results in a more diversified maturity structure (Chart 9) than in the foreign reserves portfolio.

At the end of 2022, the total value of euro banknotes in circulation was €1,572.0 billion, an increase of 1.8% compared to the end of 2021. The ECB has been allocated an 8% share of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, which amounted to €125.8 billion at the end of the year. Since the ECB does not issue banknotes itself, it holds intra-Eurosystem claims vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs for a value equivalent to the value of the banknotes in circulation.
The ECB’s intra-Eurosystem liabilities, which mainly comprise the net TARGET2 balance of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB and the ECB’s liabilities with regard to the foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the euro area NCBs when they joined the Eurosystem, decreased by €19.7 billion to €355.5 billion in 2022.
The development of the intra-Eurosystem liabilities over the period from 2018 to 2020, was mostly driven by the evolution of the net TARGET2 liability as a result of the ECB’s net purchases of securities held for monetary policy purposes, which are settled via TARGET2 accounts (Chart 10). In 2021 and 2022 the impact of monetary policy securities purchases on the net TARGET2 liability was more than offset by other factors. In 2022 these factors were mainly the higher deposits of euro area residents accepted by the ECB in its role as fiscal agent
[

and the higher balances of euro area ancillary systems connected to TARGET2 through the TARGET2-ECB component.

The ECB’s other liabilities consist mainly of deposits accepted by the ECB in its role as fiscal agent and balances of ancillary systems connected to TARGET2 through the TARGET2-ECB component. In 2022 the ECB’s other liabilities increased by €33.2 billion to €165.7 billion, mainly due to higher deposits of euro area residents accepted in its role as fiscal agent.
1.3.2 Financial resources
The ECB’s financial resources consist of its capital, any amounts held in the provision for financial risks and the general reserve fund, the revaluation accounts and any profit for the year. These financial resources are (i) invested in assets that generate income and/or (ii) used to offset losses. As at 31 December 2022, the ECB’s financial resources totalled €51.6 billion (Chart 11). This was €1.8 billion higher than in 2021 owing to (i) the increase in the revaluation accounts as a result of the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro and the rise in the market price of gold in euro terms in 2022 and (ii) the increase in the paid-up capital. These increases were partially offset, mainly by the reduction in the provision for financial risks following its partial use to offset losses incurred in 2022.

Note: “Revaluation accounts” includes total revaluation gains on gold, foreign currency and securities holdings, but excludes the revaluation account for post-employment benefits.
Unrealised gains on gold and foreign currencies and unrealised gains on securities that are subject to price revaluation are not recognised as income in the Profit and Loss Account but are recorded directly in revaluation accounts shown on the liability side of the ECB’s Balance Sheet. The balances in these accounts can be used to absorb the impact of any future unfavourable movement in the respective prices and/or exchange rates and thus strengthen the ECB’s resilience against the underlying risks. In 2022 the revaluation accounts for gold, foreign currencies and securities
[
14
]
increased by €3.0 billion to €36.1 billion owing to higher revaluation balances for foreign currencies and gold as a result of the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro and the rise in the market price of gold in euro terms (Chart 12), which were partially offset by the decrease in the revaluation balances for securities.

Following the Bank of England’s departure from the ESCB in 2020, the shares of the remaining NCBs in the subscribed capital of the ECB increased. The Governing Council decided that the remaining NCBs would cover only the Bank of England’s withdrawn paid-up capital of €58 million in 2020 and that the euro area NCBs would pay up in full their increased subscriptions in two equal annual instalments in 2021 and 2022. Following the payment of the final instalment by the euro area NCBs, the ECB’s paid-up capital increased by €0.6 billion to €8.9 billion in 2022.
[
15
]
In view of its exposure to financial risks (see Section 1.4.1 “Financial risks”), the ECB maintains a provision for financial risks. The provision for financial risks, together with any amount held in the ECB’s general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs. The size of this provision is reviewed annually, taking a range of factors into account, including the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the projected results for the coming year and a risk assessment. Following the annual review, the Governing Council decided to release €1,627 million from the provision for financial risks to offset losses incurred in 2022, after which the ECB’s financial result was zero (see Section 1.3.3 “Profit and Loss Account”). Following this release, the size of the provision for financial risks fell to €6.6 billion.
1.3.3 Profit and Loss Account
After several years of increases, the ECB’s annual profit reached a peak in 2019 before starting to decrease in 2020. The movements in the ECB’s profit were driven mainly by changes in the income generated on foreign reserve assets and on securities held for monetary policy purposes. In 2021 there was also a significant transfer to the provision for financial risks, which reduced the ECB’s profit by a corresponding amount.
Following the release of €1,627 million from the provision for financial risks to offset losses incurred in 2022, the ECB’s financial result was zero (2021: €192 million). The losses mainly arose from (i) the interest expense resulting from the ECB’s net TARGET2 liability and (ii) the negative net result from financial operations and write-downs (Chart 13).

Note: “Other income and expenses” consists of “Net income/expense from fees and commissions”, “Income from equity shares and participating interests”, “Other income” and “Other expenses”.
The net interest income of the ECB decreased by €666 million to €900 million (Chart 14), mainly owing to the interest expense resulting from the ECB’s net TARGET2 liability. The interest expense related to the remuneration of euro area NCBs’ claims in respect of foreign reserves transferred to the ECB also contributed to this decrease. These expenses were partially offset by higher interest income arising from (i) the ECB’s claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem, (ii) foreign reserve assets and (iii) securities held for monetary policy purposes.
Chart 14
Net interest income
(EUR millions)
Source: ECB.
Net interest income generated on securities held for monetary policy purposes increased by €528 million to €1,534 million in 2022 (Chart 15), mainly owing to the higher net interest income arising from the APP (from securities held under the CBPP3, ABSPP and PSPP) and the lower negative net interest income on the PEPP portfolio. APP net interest income rose by €424 million to €1,571 million in 2022, while PEPP negative net interest income fell to €103 million from €252 million. These developments were mainly driven by the significant rise in euro area bond yields in 2022 (Chart 16), which allowed purchases of securities under both programmes at higher yields than the historical yield of the respective portfolios. Net interest income on the SMP, CBPP1 and CBPP2 portfolios decreased by €45 million to €66 million owing to the decline in the size of these portfolios as a result of maturing securities.

Net interest income on foreign reserve assets increased by €602 million to €798 million, predominantly as a result of higher interest income from securities denominated in US dollars. The average interest rate earned on the ECB’s US dollar portfolio increased in 2022 compared to the previous year owing to (i) sales and redemptions of lower-yield bonds purchased in the past and (ii) purchases of securities with higher yields owing to the increase in US dollar bond yields since the end of 2021 (Chart 17).

Interest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes to the ECB and interest expense stemming from the remuneration of NCBs’ claims in respect of foreign reserves transferred amounted to €736 million and €201 million respectively in 2022, while both were zero in the previous year. The changes were the result of increases in the rate on the main refinancing operations (MRO), which is the rate used for the interest calculation on these balances. This rate had stood at 0% since March 2016, but was increased gradually as of 27 July 2022 and stood at 2.5% at the end of the year.
The net interest expense arising from TARGET2 balances due to/from NCBs amounted to €2,075 million, compared to an interest income of €22 million in 2021. The net interest expense in 2022 resulted from the remuneration of the ECB’s intra-Eurosystem TARGET2 balances at the MRO rate, which started increasing in 2022. The interest income of €22 million in 2021 resulted from the remuneration of TARGET2 balances of non-euro area NCBs at a negative average remuneration rate.
Net other interest income decreased, mainly owing to the remuneration of deposits accepted by the ECB in its role as fiscal agent. While in 2021 the ECB earned interest income on these deposits owing to the negative average remuneration rate applied to them, in 2022 the ECB incurred an interest expense as the applicable remuneration rates turned positive and average deposits were higher towards the end of the year. This was partially offset by the higher interest income earned on the own funds portfolio as a result of increasing yields in the euro area (Chart 16).
Net realised losses arising from financial operations increased by €104 million to €110 million in 2022 (Chart 18). This was due to price losses realised mainly on sales of US dollar-denominated securities, as their market value was negatively affected by the increase in US dollar bond yields during the year (Chart 17). These losses occurred mainly in the last three quarters of 2022 (Chart 19). The realised price losses were partially offset by realised exchange rate gains, which largely arose as a consequence of the year-end price write-downs of US dollar securities.

Unrealised revaluation losses are expensed in the form of write-downs at the year-end in the ECB’s Profit and Loss Account. In 2022 these write-downs amounted to €1,840 million, compared to €133 million in 2021 (Chart 20), and resulted mainly from the decline in the market value of securities held in the own funds and US dollar portfolios as a result of the significant increase in the corresponding yields.

As at 31 December 2022, the Governing Council decided to release €1,627 million from the ECB’s provision for financial risks to offset losses incurred in 2022 (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”).
The total operating expenses of the ECB, including depreciation and banknote production services, decreased by €14 million to €1,224 million (Chart 21). The decrease compared to 2021 was mainly due to lower staff costs resulting from actuarial gains in relation to other long-term benefits as a consequence of the higher discount rate used for the actuarial valuation at the end of 2022. Administrative expenses increased slightly, mainly owing to a gradual return to normal levels of activity following the pandemic and the new and improved IT services in banking supervision.
Banking supervision-related expenses are fully covered by fees levied on the supervised entities. Based on the actual expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its banking supervision tasks, supervisory fee income for 2022 stood at €594 million.

1.4 Risk management
Risk management is a critical part of the ECB’s activities and is conducted through a continuous process of (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) review of the risk strategy and policies, (iii) implementation of risk mitigating actions and (iv) risk monitoring and reporting, all of which are supported by effective methodologies, processes and systems.
Figure 2
Risk management cycle
The following sections focus on the risks, their sources and the applicable risk control frameworks.
1.4.1 Financial risks
The Executive Board proposes policies and procedures that ensure an appropriate level of protection against the financial risks to which the ECB is exposed. The Risk Management Committee (RMC), which comprises experts from Eurosystem central banks, contributes to the monitoring, measuring and reporting of financial risks related to the balance sheet of the Eurosystem and defines and reviews the associated methodologies and frameworks. In this way, the RMC helps the decision-making bodies to ensure an appropriate level of protection for the Eurosystem.
Financial risks arise from the ECB’s core activities and associated exposures. The risk control frameworks and limits that the ECB uses to manage its risk profile differ across types of operation, reflecting the policy or investment objectives of the different portfolios and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
To monitor and assess the risks, the ECB relies on a number of risk estimation techniques developed by its experts. These techniques are based on a joint market and credit risk simulation framework. The core modelling concepts, techniques and assumptions underlying the risk measures draw on industry standards and available market data. The risks are typically quantified as the expected shortfall (ES),
[
17
]
estimated at the 99% confidence level over a one-year horizon. Two approaches are used to calculate risks: (i) the accounting approach, under which the ECB’s revaluation accounts are considered as a buffer in the calculation of risk estimates in line with all applicable accounting rules; and (ii) the financial approach, under which the revaluation accounts are not considered as a buffer in the risk calculation. The ECB also calculates other risk measures at different confidence levels, performs sensitivity and stress scenario analyses and assesses longer-term projections of exposures and income to maintain a comprehensive picture of the risks.
[
18
]
The total risks of the ECB increased during the year. At the end of 2022 the total financial risks for all the ECB’s portfolios combined, as measured by the ES at the 99% confidence level over a one-year horizon under the accounting approach, stood at €16.0 billion, which was €0.7 billion higher than the risks estimated as at the end of 2021 (Chart 22). The rise in estimated risks continued a trend which began in 2020 and reflects the growth of the ECB’s monetary policy portfolios as a result of asset purchases conducted under the PEPP and the APP.
Chart 22
Total financial risks (ES 99%, accounting approach)
(EUR billions)

Credit risk arises from the ECB’s monetary policy portfolios, its euro-denominated own funds portfolio and its foreign reserve holdings. While securities held for monetary policy purposes are valued at amortised cost subject to impairment and are therefore, in the absence of sales, not subject to price changes associated with credit migrations, they are still subject to credit default risk. Euro-denominated own funds and foreign reserves are valued at market prices and, as such, are subject to credit migration and default risk. Credit risk increased compared with the previous year owing to the expansion of the ECB’s Balance Sheet through purchases of securities under the PEPP and the APP.
Credit risk is mitigated mainly through the application of eligibility criteria, due diligence procedures and limits that differ across portfolios.
Currency and commodity risks arise from the ECB’s foreign currency and gold holdings. The currency risk remained stable compared with 2021.
In view of the policy role of these assets, the ECB does not hedge the related currency and commodity risks. Instead, these risks are mitigated through the existence of revaluation accounts and the diversification of the holdings across different currencies and gold.
The ECB’s foreign reserves and euro-denominated own funds are mainly invested in fixed income securities and are subject to mark-to-market interest rate risk, given that they are valued at market prices. The ECB’s foreign reserves are mainly invested in assets with relatively short maturities (see Chart 7 in Section 1.3.1 “Balance Sheet”), while the assets in the own funds portfolio generally have longer maturities (see Chart 9 in Section 1.3.1 “Balance Sheet”). The interest rate risk of these portfolios, as measured under the accounting approach, increased compared to 2021, reflecting developments in market conditions.
The mark-to-market interest rate risk of the ECB is mitigated through asset allocation policies and the revaluation accounts.
The ECB is also subject to interest rate risk arising from mismatches between the interest rate earned on its assets and the interest rate paid on its liabilities, which has an impact on its net interest income. This risk is not directly linked to any particular portfolio but rather to the structure of the ECB’s Balance Sheet as a whole and, in particular, the existence of maturity and yield mismatches between assets and liabilities. It is monitored by means of projections of the ECB’s profitability, which indicate that the ECB, before any releases from or transfers to the provision for financial risks may experience losses in the short to medium term, while expecting a return to profits in the long run.
This type of risk is managed through asset allocation policies and is further mitigated by the existence of unremunerated liabilities on the ECB’s Balance Sheet.
The risks associated with climate change will gradually be incorporated into the ECB’s risk management framework in the coming years. In 2022 the Eurosystem conducted the first climate stress test of the Eurosystem balance sheet
[
19
]
, which allowed a preliminary estimate of the impact of this risk on the ECB’s Balance Sheet to be obtained. In the coming years climate stress testing will be performed on a regular basis.
1.4.2 Operational risk
The Executive Board is responsible for and approves the ECB’s operational risk
[

management (ORM) policy and framework. The Operational Risk Committee (ORC) supports the Executive Board in the performance of its role in overseeing the management of operational risks. ORM is an integral part of the ECB’s governance structure
[
21
]
and management processes.
The main objective of the ECB’s ORM framework is to contribute to ensuring that the ECB achieves its mission and objectives, while protecting its reputation and assets against loss, misuse and damage. Under the ORM framework, each business area is responsible for identifying, assessing, responding to, reporting on and monitoring its operational risks, incidents and controls. In this context, the ECB’s risk tolerance policy provides guidance with regard to risk response strategies and risk acceptance procedures. It is linked to a five-by-five risk matrix based on impact and likelihood grading scales using quantitative and qualitative criteria.
The environment in which the ECB operates is exposed to increasingly complex and interconnected threats and there are a wide range of operational risks associated with the ECB’s day-to-day activities. The main areas of concern for the ECB include a wide spectrum of non-financial risks resulting from people, systems, processes and external events. Consequently, the ECB has put in place processes to facilitate ongoing and effective management of its operational risks and to integrate risk information into the decision-making process. Moreover, the ECB is focusing on enhancing its resilience, taking a broad view of risks and opportunities from an end-to-end perspective, including sustainability aspects. Response structures and contingency plans have been established to ensure the continuity of critical business functions in the event of any disruption or crisis.
1.4.3 Conduct risk
The ECB has a dedicated Compliance and Governance Office as a key risk management function to strengthen the ECB’s governance framework in order to address conduct risk.
[
22
]
Its purpose is to support the Executive Board in protecting the integrity and reputation of the ECB, to promote ethical standards of behaviour and to strengthen the ECB’s accountability and transparency. An independent Ethics Committee provides advice and guidance to high-level ECB officials on integrity and conduct matters and supports the Governing Council in managing risks at executive level appropriately and coherently. At the level of the Eurosystem and the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Ethics and Compliance Committee works towards achieving coherent implementation of the conduct frameworks for NCBs and national competent authorities (NCAs).
In the course of 2022, the ECB expanded its conduct risk management to also cover conduct risk stemming from the recourse to external contractors supporting ECB tasks.

2.3 Accounting policies
Form and presentation of the financial statements
The financial statements of the ECB have been drawn up in accordance with the following accounting policies,
[
23
]


which, in the view of the Governing Council of the ECB, achieve a fair presentation of the financial statements, reflecting at the same time the nature of central bank activities.
Accounting principles
The following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and transparency, prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet events, materiality, going concern, the accruals principle, consistency and comparability.
Recognition of assets and liabilities
An asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that any associated future economic benefit will flow to or from the ECB, substantially all of the associated risks and rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of the asset or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, modified to include the market valuation of marketable securities (other than securities currently held for monetary policy purposes), gold and all other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency.
Transactions in financial assets and liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the date on which they were settled.
With the exception of spot transactions in securities, transactions in financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. At the settlement date, the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed, and transactions are booked on-balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade date, and realised results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, premiums and discounts related to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign currency position is also affected daily by these accruals.
Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a currency-by-currency basis.
Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency is treated separately from the exchange rate revaluation.
Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the balance sheet date. No distinction is made between the price and currency revaluation differences for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is accounted for on the basis of the price in euro per fine ounce of gold, which, for the year ending 31 December 2022, was derived from the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar on 30 December 2022.
The special drawing right (SDR) is defined in terms of a basket of currencies and its value is determined by the weighted sum of the exchange rates of five major currencies (the US dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen and pound sterling). The ECB’s holdings of SDRs were converted into euro using the exchange rate of the euro against the SDR as at 30 December 2022.
Securities
Securities held for monetary policy purposes
Securities currently held for monetary policy purposes are accounted for at amortised cost subject to impairment.
Other securities
Marketable securities (other than securities currently held for monetary policy purposes) and similar assets are valued either at the mid-market prices or on the basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance sheet date, on a security-by-security basis. Options embedded in securities are not separated for valuation purposes. For the year ending 31 December 2022, mid-market prices on 30 December 2022 were used.
Marketable investment funds are revalued on a net basis at fund level, using their net asset value. No netting is applied between unrealised gains and losses in different investment funds.
Illiquid equity shares and any other equity instruments held as permanent investments are valued at cost subject to impairment.
Income recognition
Income and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred.
[
24
]
Realised gains and losses resulting from the sale of foreign currency, gold and securities are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account. Such realised gains and losses are calculated by reference to the average cost of the respective asset.
Unrealised gains are not recognised as income and are transferred directly to a revaluation account.
Unrealised losses are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account if, at the year-end, they exceed previous revaluation gains accumulated in the corresponding revaluation account. Such unrealised losses on any one security or currency or on gold are not netted against unrealised gains on other securities or currencies or gold. In the event of such unrealised losses on any item recorded in the Profit and Loss Account, the average cost of that item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate or market price.
Impairment losses are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account and are not reversed in subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related to an observable event that occurred after the impairment was first recorded.
Premiums or discounts arising on securities are amortised over the securities’ remaining contractual life.
Reverse transactions
Reverse transactions are operations whereby the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.
Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised deposits on the liability side of the Balance Sheet. Securities sold under such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet of the ECB.
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous agreement to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised loans on the asset side of the Balance Sheet, but are not included in the ECB’s security holdings.
Reverse transactions (including securities lending transactions) conducted under a programme offered by a specialised institution are recorded on the Balance Sheet only where collateral has been provided in the form of cash and this cash remains uninvested.
Off-balance-sheet instruments
Currency instruments, namely foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one currency for another at a future date, are included in the net foreign currency position for the purpose of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses.
Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation margin of open interest rate futures contracts are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account. The valuation of forward transactions in securities is carried out by the ECB based on generally accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates, as well as discount factors from the settlement dates to the valuation date.
Fixed assets
Fixed assets, including intangible assets, but excluding land and works of art, are valued at cost less depreciation. Land and works of art are valued at cost. The ECB’s main building is valued at cost less depreciation subject to impairment. For the depreciation of the ECB’s main building, costs are assigned to the appropriate asset components, which are depreciated in accordance with their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, beginning in the quarter after the asset is available for use. The useful lives applied for the main asset classes are as follows:
The depreciation period for capitalised refurbishment expenditure relating to the ECB’s existing rented premises is adjusted to take account of any events that have an impact on the expected useful life of the affected asset.
The ECB performs an annual impairment test of its main building and right-of-use assets relating to office buildings (see “Leases” below). If an impairment indicator is identified, and it is assessed that the asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recorded in the Profit and Loss Account if the recoverable amount is less than the net book value.
Fixed assets costing less than €10,000 are written off in the year of acquisition.
Fixed assets that comply with the capitalisation criteria, but are still under construction or development, are recorded under the heading “Assets under construction”. The related costs are transferred to the relevant fixed asset headings once the assets are available for use.
Leases
For all leases involving a tangible asset, the related right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lease commencement date and included under “Tangible and intangible fixed assets” and “Sundry” (liabilities), respectively. Where leases comply with the capitalisation criteria, but the asset involved is still under construction or adaptation, the incurred costs before the lease commencement date are recorded under the heading “Assets under construction”. The related right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised under the relevant fixed asset headings once the asset is available for use (lease commencement date).
Right-of-use assets are valued at cost less depreciation. In addition, right-of-use assets relating to office buildings are subject to impairment (regarding the annual impairment test, see “Fixed assets” above). Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to either the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is earlier.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments (comprising only lease components), discounted using the ECB's incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The related interest expense is recorded in the Profit and Loss Account under “Other interest expense”. When there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or other reassessment of the existing contract, the lease liability is remeasured. Any such remeasurement results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.
Short-term leases with a duration of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets below €10,000 (consistent with the threshold used for the recognition of fixed assets) are recorded as an expense in the Profit and Loss Account.
The ECB’s post-employment benefits, other long-term benefits and termination benefits
The ECB operates defined benefit plans for its staff and the members of the Executive Board, as well as for the members of the Supervisory Board employed by the ECB.
The staff pension plan is funded by assets held in a long-term employee benefit fund. The compulsory contributions made by the ECB and the staff are reflected in the defined benefit pillar of the plan. Staff can make additional contributions on a voluntary basis in a defined contribution pillar that can be used to provide additional benefits.
[
25
]
These additional benefits are determined by the amount of voluntary contributions together with the investment returns arising from those contributions.
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the post-employment and other long-term benefits of members of the Executive Board and members of the Supervisory Board employed by the ECB. For staff, unfunded arrangements are in place for post-employment benefits other than pensions and for other long-term benefits and termination benefits.
Net defined benefit liability
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet under “Sundry” (liabilities) in respect of the defined benefit plans, including other long-term benefits and termination benefits, is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the related obligation.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality euro-denominated corporate bonds that have similar terms to maturity to the related obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual outcomes are different from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
Net defined benefit cost
The net defined benefit cost is split into components reported in the Profit and Loss Account and remeasurements in respect of post-employment benefits shown in the Balance Sheet under “Revaluation accounts”.
The net amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account comprises:
the current service cost of the defined benefits accruing for the year;
the past service cost of the defined benefits resulting from a plan amendment;
net interest at the discount rate on the net defined benefit liability;
remeasurements in respect of other long-term benefits and termination benefits of a long-term nature, if any, in their entirety.
The net amount shown under “Revaluation accounts” comprises the following items:
actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation;
the actual return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability;
any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
These amounts are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate liability in the financial statements.
Intra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balances
Intra-ESCB balances result primarily from cross-border payments in the European Union (EU) that are settled in central bank money in euro. These transactions are for the most part initiated by private entities (i.e. credit institutions, corporations and individuals). They are settled in TARGET2 – the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system – and give rise to bilateral balances in the TARGET2 accounts of EU central banks. These bilateral balances are netted and then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each national central bank (NCB) with a single net bilateral position vis-à-vis the ECB only. Payments conducted by the ECB and settled in TARGET2 also affect the single net bilateral positions. These positions in the books of the ECB represent the net claim or liability of each NCB against the rest of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Intra-Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB arising from TARGET2, as well as other intra-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro (e.g. the ECB’s interim profit distribution to NCBs, if any), are presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or liability position under either “Other claims within the Eurosystem (net)” or “Other liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)”. Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB, arising from their participation in TARGET2,
[
26
]
are disclosed under “Liabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euro”.
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem are included as a single net asset under “Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem” (see “Banknotes in circulation” below).
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB by NCBs joining the Eurosystem are denominated in euro and reported under “Liabilities equivalent to the transfer of foreign reserves”.
Banknotes in circulation
The ECB and the euro area NCBs, which together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro banknotes.
[
27
]
The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central banks on the last working day of each month in accordance with the banknote allocation key.
[
28
]
The ECB has been allocated an 8% share of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, which is disclosed in the Balance Sheet under the liability item “Banknotes in circulation”. The ECB’s share of the total euro banknote issue is backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, which bear interest,
[
29
]
are disclosed under the item “Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem” (see “Intra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balances” above). Interest income on these claims is included in the Profit and Loss Account under the item “Interest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem”.
Interim profit distribution
An amount that is equal to the sum of the ECB’s income on euro banknotes in circulation and income arising from the securities held for monetary policy purposes purchased under (i) the Securities Markets Programme; (ii) the third covered bond purchase programme; (iii) the asset-backed securities purchase programme; (iv) the public sector purchase programme; and (v) the pandemic emergency purchase programme is distributed in January of the following year by means of an interim profit distribution, unless otherwise decided by the Governing Council.
[
30
]
Any such decision shall be taken where, on the basis of a reasoned estimate prepared by the Executive Board, the Governing Council expects that the ECB will have an overall annual loss or will make an annual profit that is less than this income. The Governing Council may also decide to transfer all or part of this income to a provision for financial risks. Furthermore, the Governing Council may decide to reduce the amount of the income on euro banknotes in circulation to be distributed in January by the amount of the costs incurred by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of euro banknotes.
Post-balance-sheet events
The values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance sheet date and the date on which the Executive Board authorises the submission of the ECB’s Annual Accounts to the Governing Council for approval, if such events materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Important post-balance-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.
Changes to accounting policies
In 2022 there were no changes to the accounting policies applied by the ECB.
Other issues
In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation of the Governing Council, the EU Council has approved the appointment of Baker Tilly GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf (Federal Republic of Germany) as the external auditors of the ECB for a five-year period up to the end of the financial year 2022. This five-year period can be extended for up to two additional financial years.
2.4 Notes on the Balance Sheet
Note 1 - Gold and gold receivables
As at 31 December 2022 the ECB held 16,229,522 ounces of fine gold
[
31
]
, the market value of which amounted to €27,689 million (2021: €26,121 million). No gold operations took place in 2022 and the ECB’s holdings therefore remained unchanged compared with their level as at 31 December 2021. The increase in the euro equivalent value of these holdings was due to the rise in the market price of gold in euro terms (see “Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies” and note 15 “Revaluation accounts”).
Note 2 - Claims on non-euro area and euro area residents denominated in foreign currency
Note 2.1 - Receivables from the IMF
This asset represents the ECB’s holdings of SDRs and amounted to €1,759 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: €1,234 million). It arises as the result of a two-way SDR buying and selling voluntary trading arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of the ECB, within minimum and maximum holding levels. For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency (see “Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”). The ECB’s holdings of SDRs increased in 2022, mainly as a result of a transaction that took place in the context of the above-mentioned voluntary trading arrangement.
Note 2.2 - Balances with banks and security investments, external loans and other external assets; and claims on euro area residents denominated in foreign currency
These two items consist of balances with banks and loans denominated in foreign currency, and investments in securities denominated in US dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
The total value of these items increased in 2022, mainly owing to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro.
The ECB’s net foreign currency holdings
[
32
]
were as follows:
No foreign exchange interventions took place during 2022.
Note 3 - Claims on non-euro area residents denominated in euro
Note 3.1 - Balances with banks, security investments and loans
As at 31 December 2022 there were no balances under this item, while at the end of 2021 this item had consisted of a claim amounting to €3,070 million in relation to liquidity facility arrangements between the Eurosystem and non-euro area central banks.
[
33
]
Note 4 - Other claims on euro area credit institutions denominated in euro
As at 31 December 2022 this item consisted of current account balances with euro area residents amounting to €12 million (2021: €38 million).
Note 5 - Securities of euro area residents denominated in euro
Note 5.1 - Securities held for monetary policy purposes
As at 31 December 2022 this item consisted of securities acquired by the ECB within the scope of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).
All securities held under the first and the second covered bond purchase programmes (CBPP1 and CBPP2) matured in the course of 2022, and therefore the ECB and the euro area NCBs had no holdings of these securities as at 31 December 2022.
1) Further eligibility criteria for the specific programmes can be found in the Governing Council’s decisions.
2) Only public debt securities issued by five euro area treasuries were purchased under the SMP.
3) The ECB does not acquire securities under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).
4) A waiver of the eligibility requirements was granted for securities issued by the Greek Government.
During the first quarter of 2022, the Eurosystem continued its net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP)
[
34
]
at a monthly pace of €20 billion on average. In March 2022 the Governing Council decided
[
35
]
to revise the net purchase amounts to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June, and in June 2022 the Governing Council decided
[
36
]
to end net asset purchases under the APP as of 1 July 2022. The Governing Council intends
[
37
]
to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities until the end of February 2023. Thereafter the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion a month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2022, the Eurosystem continued its net asset purchases under the PEPP
[
38
]
, albeit at a lower pace than in the previous quarter, following the decision of the Governing Council in December 2021.
[
39
]
Based on the same decision, net PEPP purchases were discontinued at the end of March 2022. The Governing Council intends to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility across time, asset classes and jurisdictions in the reinvestments, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. The future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The securities purchased under these programmes are valued on an amortised cost basis subject to impairment (see “Securities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”).
The amortised cost of the securities held by the ECB and their market value
[
40
]
(which is not recorded on the Balance Sheet or in the Profit and Loss Account and is provided for comparison purposes only) were as follows:
The amortised cost value of the securities held by the ECB changed during the year as follows:
1) ""Net discount/(premium)"" includes net realised gains/(losses), if any.
The Governing Council assesses on a regular basis the financial risks associated with the securities held under these programmes.
In this context, impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis, using data as at the year-end, and are approved by the Governing Council. In these tests, impairment indicators are assessed separately for each programme. In cases where impairment indicators are observed, further analysis is performed to confirm that the cash flows of the underlying securities have not been affected by an impairment event. Based on the results of this year’s impairment tests, no losses have been recorded by the ECB for the securities held in its monetary policy portfolios in 2022.
The amortised cost value of the securities held by the Eurosystem was as follows:
Note: “Euro area NCBs” figures are preliminary and may be subject to revision, which would also result in an equivalent change in the “Total Eurosystem” figures.
Note 6 - Intra-Eurosystem claims
Note 6.1 - Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem
This item consists of the claims of the ECB vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs relating to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem (see “Banknotes in circulation” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”) and as at 31 December 2022 amounted to €125,763 million (2021: €123,551 million). The remuneration of these claims is calculated daily at the latest available interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations (see note 23.2 “Interest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem”).
Note 7 - Other assets
Note 7.1 - Tangible and intangible fixed assets
These assets comprised the following items:
In respect of the ECB’s main building and right-of-use office buildings, an impairment test was conducted at the end of the year and no impairment loss has been recorded.
Note 7.2 - Other financial assets
This item consists mainly of the ECB’s own funds portfolio, which predominantly consists of investments of the ECB’s financial resources, namely the paid-up capital and amounts set aside in the general reserve fund and in the provision for financial risks. It also includes 3,211 shares in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at the acquisition cost of €42 million and other current accounts denominated in euro.
The components of this item were as follows:
The net increase in this item in 2022 was primarily due to the investment in the ECB’s own funds portfolio of a total amount equal to the amount transferred to the ECB’s provision for financial risks in 2021 and the amount paid up by the euro area NCBs in 2022 in respect of the second instalment of their increased subscriptions in the ECB’s capital (see note 16 “Capital and reserves”). The increase in this item was largely offset, mainly by the decline in the market value of euro-denominated securities held in the ECB’s own funds portfolio.
Note 7.3 - Off-balance-sheet instruments revaluation differences
This item is composed of valuation changes in swap and forward transactions in foreign currency that were outstanding on 31 December 2022 (see note 20 “Foreign exchange swap and forward transactions”). These valuation changes amounted to €783 million (2021: €620 million) and are the result of the conversion of such transactions into their euro equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, compared with the euro values resulting from the conversion of the transactions at the average cost of the respective foreign currency on that date (see “Off-balance-sheet instruments” and “Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”).
Note 7.4 - Accruals and prepaid expenses
This item comprised the following components:
As at 31 December 2022 the largest component of this item was accrued interest on financial instruments, mainly stemming from coupon interest on securities, including outstanding interest paid at acquisition (see note 2.2 “Balances with banks and security investments, external loans and other external assets; and claims on euro area residents denominated in foreign currency”, note 5 “Securities of euro area residents denominated in euro” and note 7.2 “Other financial assets”).
It also included accrued interest receivable on TARGET2 balances due from euro area NCBs for December 2022 (see note 12.2 “Other liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)”) and accrued interest receivable from euro area NCBs"

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-September 2022, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector and comprise a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-September 2022 data refer to 311 banking groups and 2396 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s implementing technical standards on supervisory reporting, while some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
Some revisions to past data are disclosed together with the end-September 2022 data.

New ceiling for remuneration of euro area government deposits to be set at the euro short-term rate (€STR) minus 20 basis points, taking effect on 1 May 2023
Remuneration of deposits held under the Eurosystem reserve management services (ERMS) framework to be adjusted accordingly
Measure aims to provide incentives for a gradual and orderly reduction of such deposits held with the Eurosystem, in order to minimise the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy
Remuneration regime will be monitored and adjusted if necessary
On 8 September 2022 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to temporarily remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits held with the Eurosystem, setting the ceiling for such remuneration at the deposit facility rate or the €STR, whichever was lower, until 30 April 2023. The Governing Council has now decided to adjust the ceiling for the remuneration of such deposits as of 1 May 2023, in order to provide incentives for a gradual and orderly reduction of those holdings, thereby minimising the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy. This decision also alters the remuneration of deposits held under the ERMS framework.
As of 1 May 2023 the ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits will be the €STR minus 20 basis points. This change reflects the fact that, while conditions in the repo market have improved since September 2022, the market remains fragile. There is persistent collateral scarcity in some segments, and banks are still constrained in their ability to intermediate a substantial amount of excess liquidity. Consequently, it is important that these deposits return to the market in a gradual manner in order to minimise the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and the smooth transmission of monetary policy. This decision reflects the desire to encourage market intermediation, with the changes to the remuneration regime providing incentives for depositors to gradually phase out their holdings with the Eurosystem. The Governing Council will continue to monitor money market developments and the evolution of these deposit holdings, and it stands ready to make further adjustments to the remuneration regime if necessary.
The remuneration of deposits held under the ERMS framework will also be adjusted accordingly as of 1 May 2023.
All amendments to legal acts reflecting this new remuneration regime for government deposits will be published before the change takes effect on 1 May 2023.

Compared with November:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months ahead remained unchanged, while expectations for inflation three years ahead edged up;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased, while expectations for nominal spending growth decreased slightly;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months increased, whereas they decreased for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time;
consumer expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained broadly unchanged.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months stood at 9.9% for the third consecutive month. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months were unchanged at 5.0%, while median expectations for inflation three years ahead edged up from 2.9% to 3.0%, reversing their previous decline. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead eased somewhat compared with the levels observed since mid-2022. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.0% over the next 12 months, up from 0.9% in November. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months also edged up to 6.4%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months declined further, edging down from 4.3% to 4.2%. Expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) still reporting lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months continued to increase noticeably, moving up from -2.0% in November to -1.5%. In line with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead declined markedly to 11.9%, compared with 12.4% in November. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.6%). The lowest income quintile reported the highest expected and perceived unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected the growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to continue to hover around 3.0%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained stable at 4.8%, 1.5 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Following the loosening reported in November, perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months remained unchanged overall.

HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2023 and 2024, but down for longer term
Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged
Unemployment rate expectations revised down
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2023, respondents revised up their inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024. These now stand at 5.9% and 2.7% respectively; 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. The upward revisions reflect corresponding changes to expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX). According to respondents, these changes mainly reflect a combination of recent data outturns, ongoing stronger and broader than expected indirect effects of energy price developments as well as higher forecast wage growth. Expectations for 2025, which were not surveyed in the previous round, stand at 2.1%. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were revised down by 0.1 percentage points to 2.1% on average.
GDP growth expectations were largely unchanged with positive “carry-over” from stronger than expected economic activity in the second half of 2022 affecting 2023, but being offset by slightly weaker expectations for 2024 than previously reported. Longer-term GDP growth expectations remained unchanged at 1.4%.
Unemployment rate expectations were revised down for all horizons by between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points. Following an expected increase to 7.0% in 2023 (the unemployment rate stood at 6.5% in November 2022) the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually to 6.4% by 2027."
,"Summary
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2023, HICP inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 were revised up from the previous survey round (for the fourth quarter of 2022) to stand at 5.9% and 2.7% respectively.

The upward revisions primarily reflect changes to expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX). According to respondents, they mainly reflect a combination of recent data outturns, ongoing stronger and broader than expected indirect effects as well as higher forecast wage growth. Expectations for 2025, which were not surveyed in the previous round, stand at 2.1%. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were revised down by 0.1 percentage points to 2.1%. GDP growth expectations were largely unchanged with positive carry-over from stronger than expected economic activity in the second half of 2022 affecting 2023, but being offset by slightly weaker expectations for 2024 than previously reported. Longer-term GDP growth expectations remained unchanged at 1.4%. The profile for the expected unemployment rate was revised downward by between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points across all horizons. Following an expected increase to 7.0% in 2023 (the unemployment rate stood at 6.5% in November 2022), the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually to 6.4% by 2027.

1 HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2023 and 2024
SPF respondents revised up their inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024. These stand at 5.9% and 2.7% respectively, 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points higher than in the previous survey round (see Chart 1). Inflation expectations for 2025, which were not surveyed in the previous round (for the fourth quarter of 2022), stood at 2.1%. Compared with the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which were based on November 2022 HICP data as the latest available information, inflation expectations in this SPF round were lower by 0.4 percentage points for 2023 and by 0.7 percentage points for 2024 (see Table 1).
Chart 1
Inflation expectations: overall HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco
(annual percentage changes)
Regarding the near-term outlook, revisions to expected HICPX inflation (i.e. HICP excluding energy and food) were the main factor behind upward revisions to the 2023 and 2024 inflation forecasts. The combined information on HICP and HICPX expectations suggests that SPF respondents have revised their expectations for the sum of HICP energy and food down for 2023 but up for 2024. A number of respondents mentioned the impact of government measures on energy prices in 2023 that might unwind and then imply upward pressure in 2024. The factors underlying revisions to HICPX expectations are discussed below.
Notwithstanding the upward revisions to the calendar year expectations for 2023 and 2024, there are some tentative signs that inflation expectations may be levelling out. The “rolling horizon” expectations for 12 and 24 months ahead of the latest available data (i.e. for December 2023 and December 2024 HICP in the SPF round for the first quarter of 2023) were revised down to 3.6% (for December 2023) from 4.8% (for September 2023) and to 2.2% (for December 2024) from 2.4% (for September 2024).
Although easing slightly, quantitative indicators of uncertainty surrounding the shorter and medium-term inflation outlook remained close to historically high levels.
[

]
The high level of “aggregate uncertainty” stems from a combination of unprecedented “disagreement” across forecasters about their point forecasts as well as a high average level of “individual uncertainty”. Two-year ahead inflation expectations disagreement (measured by the standard deviation of point expectations) stood at 0.94 percentage points. This is down from 1.25 percentage points in the previous round, but still four times the historical average since 1999. The aggregate probability distributions for the calendar years from 2023 to 2025 are presented in Chart 2. The quantitative balance of risk indicator (calculated as the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution minus the average reported point expectation) for the two-year ahead horizon moved back sharply to be broadly balanced. In their qualitative remarks, respondents noted that the main risks related to energy prices (including possible government interventions) and their pass-through, the conflict in Ukraine and possible wage developments. For energy prices, downside as well as upside risks were mentioned. Wage developments were generally considered an upward risk.
SPF expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were revised up for 2023 and 2024. HICPX expectations for 2023 and 2024 stood at 4.4% and 2.8% respectively – representing upward revisions of 0.5 percentage points for 2023 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024. Expectations for 2025 (not surveyed in the previous round) stood at 2.3%. Respondents indicated that the upward revisions reflect recent data outturns, ongoing stronger and broader than expected indirect effects as well as higher forecast wage growth. Although only a handful provided quantitative assessments, in their qualitative comments, SPF respondents identified indirect effects from energy prices and labour costs as the main factors driving HICPX inflation forecasts. Regarding labour costs, respondents cited a mix of elevated inflation and labour market tightness as factors influencing their forecast evolution. The SPF forecasts for HICPX were broadly similar to those from the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections – being 0.2 percentage points higher for 2023, the same for 2024 and 0.1 percentage points lower for 2025 (see Table 1).
Chart 2
Aggregate probability distributions for expected inflation in 2023, 2024 and 2025
(x-axis: HICP inflation expectations, annual percentage changes; y-axis: probability, percentages)
Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in 2023, 2024 and 2025. To minimise the number of bins in the questionnaire, the upper bin for inflation outcomes was set to ? 5.0%. The fact that this would lead to most probability being assigned to the upper bin for some horizons was flagged to respondents when sending out the questionnaire.
2 Longer-term inflation expectations revised down
Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were revised down by 0.1 percentage points to stand at 2.1%. When excluding (trimming) the two highest and lowest responses in both the current and previous rounds, the average would be unchanged at 2.1% for the third consecutive round. The median (and modal) point expectation was unchanged at 2.0%. The estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution was also revised down by 0.1 percentage points to 2.1% (see Chart 3). There are thus some tentative signs that longer-term expectations, after having moved up noticeably since the third quarter of 2021, have now levelled off. In the most recent round (for the first quarter of 2023), from a balanced panel of 38 respondents who also replied in the previous round, seven respondents revised their longer-term inflation expectations upwards, five revised them downwards and 26 left them unchanged. The distribution of individual point forecasts was broadly unchanged in this round (see Chart 4). Similar to the previous two rounds, the clear modal reply was again 2.0% (45% of respondents), although once again a number of respondents reported longer-term inflation expectations at or above 2.5% (seven, or 16% in both the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022 rounds). Compared with the distributions over the period from 2014 to 2021, the distribution of longer-term inflation expectations has become much more focused on 2.0%, while expectations of inflation lower than 2% have subsided significantly.

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the spread of point forecast responses. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027.
Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations eased back but remained at elevated levels, while the balance of risks remained broadly neutral. The decrease in “aggregate uncertainty” (the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution) (see Chart 5) was mainly owing to lower “disagreement” (primarily reflecting the downward revision of a strong outlier) but also to some extent to lower “individual uncertainty” (as measured by the average width of the individual probability distributions). The balance of risk indicator remained close to zero (i.e. balanced or neutral). The probability associated with longer-term inflation being in the 1.5-2.5% range increased slightly to 48% from 46% in the previous round. The probability associated with outcomes above this range (i.e. >2.5%) decreased marginally to 32% from 33% and the probability of outcomes below this range (i.e. <1.5%) remained unchanged at 20%.

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in the longer term. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027.
The longer-term expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) decreased further to 2.0% from 2.1% in the previous round (and from 2.2% in the third quarter of 2022 round). The median longer-term point expectation for HICPX edged back up to 2.0% from 1.9%, while the modal (most frequent) response remained at 2.0%; 39% reported 2.0% (30% previously), 39% reported 1.9% or lower and 21% reported 2.1% or higher. Of the 28 respondents who provided longer-term HICPX expectations in both the first quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022 rounds, an equal number (five) revised them up as revised them down, while 18 left them unchanged. The relative evolution of longer-term expectations for HICP and HICPX inflation has been broadly stable for the period of available data since the fourth quarter of 2016 (when expectations for HICPX were first asked), with a level difference of around 0.1 percentage points on average.
3 Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged
GDP growth expectations in the first quarter of 2023 survey round stood at 0.2% for 2023, at 1.4% for 2024 and at 1.7% for 2025 (see Chart 6). These imply an upward revision compared with the previous round of 0.1 percentage points for 2023, but a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points for 2024. The upward revision for 2023 mainly results from “carry-over” from a more positive second half of 2022 (owing to better-than-expected data for the third quarter and more positive indicators for the fourth). Growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 was still expected to be negative (the expectation for the first quarter of 2023 was in line with that from the previous round). In terms of underlying factors, fiscal support is expected to increase and the energy situation is improving (due to comfortable gas reserves, a decrease in prices, supplier diversification and warmer than normal weather). These developments are counterbalanced by persistent inflation and the ongoing pass-through of energy prices to consumers, which will harm real incomes, and to increased costs of financing, due to higher-than-expected rate hikes. Uncertainty has broadly moderated. The degradation in the 2024 outlook can be attributed to the effect of higher interest rates, persistent inflation and fears over the continuity of government support. Risks are still negative. The perspective of persistent inflation and the danger of higher energy prices, along with Europe’s inability to find new energy suppliers remain the most cited risks. Supply bottlenecks were no longer a top concern for respondents, who expect a complete normalisation by 2024. Downward risks related to the war in Ukraine remain. Longer-term growth expectations (which refer to 2027) remained unchanged at 1.4%.
Chart 6
Expectations for real GDP growth
(annual percentage changes)
The respondents’ profile of their short-term GDP outlook (from the fourth quarter of 2022 until the third quarter of 2023) implies two quarters of negative economic growth.
[

]
Actual quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for the third quarter of 2022 was 0.3%, substantially higher than the forecast of -0.1% in the previous SPF. In this round, forecasters expected two quarters of negative quarter-on-quarter growth (fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023) before some recovery starting in the second quarter of 2023. Overall they expect economic activity to stagnate, at around 0.0% on average between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2023 (see Chart 7). In more detail, nearly all forecasters expected at least one quarter of negative growth while 85% forecast a “technical recession” (i.e. two consecutive quarters of negative growth) over the period. Compared with the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, SPF forecasts were more pessimistic for the first quarter of 2023 (-0.3% vs -0.1%) but were otherwise broadly similar for the second and third quarters of 2023.
Chart 7
Expected profile of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth
(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes)
Notes: Grey area indicates one standard deviation (of individual expectations) around average SPF expectation.
Although the profile for the expected level of economic activity has been revised up slightly since the previous round, it still remains substantially (3%) below the profile before the invasion of Ukraine (see Chart 8). Before the Ukraine invasion (first quarter of 2022 round) GDP was expected to surpass the pre-pandemic level of its expected profile in the course of 2023. Now the level of GDP is expected to remain below the pre-pandemic level of its expected profile at least until 2026 (by about 3%). Expected GDP levels in 2024 and 2025 are also slightly lower than forecast in the December Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections (by about 0.5% and 0.6% respectively) in both cases. Respondents consider current output to be below potential and expect the negative output gap to close only gradually over the SPF horizon.
Chart 8
Forecast profile of real GDP level
(2019 = 100)
Note: Growth expectations for years not surveyed have been interpolated linearly.
Quantitative measures of uncertainty continued moderating this round and the balances of risks improved, especially at the two-year horizon (see Chart 9 and Chart 10). Aggregate uncertainty decreased at the two-year ahead and longer-term horizons, remaining above levels which prevailed before the COVID-19 pandemic, but still considerably lower than at its peak in the second and third quarters of 2020. The balance of risks improved substantially for the two-year ahead horizon but remained slightly on the downside. On the longer horizon, it improved slightly.

4 Unemployment rate expectations broadly revised down
Unemployment rate expectations in the first quarter of 2023 round were 7.0%, 6.9% and 6.7% for 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively. These were revised down from the previous round by 0.1 percentage points for 2023 and 2024. The expectation for 2027 was 6.4%, with a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points, remaining close to the historical lows observed for the long-term unemployment expectations. After an increase in 2023 (from 6.5% in November 2022), the unemployment rate is expected to follow a downward sloping trajectory parallel to what was observed in the previous round, although at a lower level (see Chart 11). Respondents reported the good state of the labour market, characterised by recent low realisations of the unemployment rate and high vacancy rates, the possible implementation of short-term job retention schemes should they be required, and more optimistic growth expectations, as the reasons for a downward revision of short and medium-term unemployment expectations. Upside risks were seen in a stronger slowdown of economic activity, also due to higher energy and financing costs. By contrast, demographic factors and labour shortages in certain sectors were frequently mentioned as downside risks.
Chart 11
Expectations for the unemployment rate
(percentages of the labour force)
Uncertainty around unemployment rate expectations decreased slightly for all horizons, remaining at relatively high levels and the balance of risks is broadly neutral for all horizons. On balance, the distributions continued losing the somewhat positive skewness of previous rounds, showing a greater degree of symmetry for all horizons (see Chart 12 and Chart 13). The balance of risk indicator for longer-term expectations was marginally positive, as the mean of the aggregated probability distribution (at 6.5%) was slightly above the average point forecast (6.4%).

5 Expectations for other variables
Forecasters expected: the ECB’s key main refinancing operations (MRO) interest rate to increase to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2023 and to 3.5% in the second quarter of 2023, before easing slightly in 2024 and in 2025 to below 3%; the euro to marginally appreciate against the dollar from 1.04 in the first quarter of 2023 to 1.08 in 2025; oil prices to remain around USD 85 per barrel in 2023, before declining towards USD 80 by 2025; and nominal wages to increase by 4.5% in 2023 and 3.9% in 2024 and to moderate to 3.1% in 2025 and to 2.6% in the long term.
Respondents expected the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to increase to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2023 and to 3.5% in the second quarter. They expect it to remain around this level for the remainder of 2023, before declining slightly in 2024 and to below 3% in 2025 (see Chart 14a). The peak expectation is for the fourth quarter of 2023 at 3.55% (although around 30% of respondents expected peak MRO interest rates of 4% or more). Compared with the previous round (for the fourth quarter of 2022), the profile has been revised up by between 0.5 and 0.7 percentage points.
The expected average USD/EUR exchange rate was revised up over all horizons, and is expected to be within the 1.04-1.06 range in 2023 and to then increase marginally to 1.08 by 2025 (see Chart 14b).
Compared with the previous round, the level of US dollar-denominated oil prices (per barrel) was revised down for 2023 but was broadly similar for 2024. Respondents envisage a relatively flat trajectory of around USD 85 per barrel up to 2024, before a decline to USD 80 per barrel in 2025 (see Chart 14c).
Expectations for the annual growth in compensation per employee were revised up slightly by 0.1 percentage points for 2023 and by somewhat more (0.4 percentage points) for 2024 (see Chart 14d). Nonetheless, respondents expect a downward sloping trajectory over the SPF horizons: 4.5%, 3.9% and 3.1% for 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively and down to 2.6% for the longer-term horizon. Longer-term expectations were revised down by 0.3 percentage points (from 2.9%).

ECB details modalities to reduce Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under the asset purchase programme through partial reinvestment, broadly in line with current practice under full reinvestment
Governing Council decided on stronger tilting of corporate bond purchases during partial reinvestment, including in primary market, towards issuers with better climate performance
As communicated in December, from the beginning of March 2023, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions.
On the basis of the December decision, the Governing Council today decided on the detailed modalities for reducing the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under APP through the partial reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities.
During the period of partial reinvestment, the Eurosystem will retain the existing smooth reinvestment approach. The monthly redemptions under the APP between March and June 2023 will exceed the decided average run-off pace of €15 billion per month. Partial reinvestments in excess of €15 billion per month will ensure that the Eurosystem maintains a continuous market presence under the APP over this period.
The remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP, i.e. the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).
Under the PSPP, the allocation of the reinvestments across jurisdictions and over time will continue to follow current practice. Specifically, the remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. Reinvestments will be distributed over time to allow a regular and balanced market presence.
For the private sector programmes (ABSPP, CBPP3 and CSPP), primary market purchases will be phased out by the start of the partial reinvestments in order to better steer the amount of the purchases conducted under each programme. The Eurosystem’s market presence during the period of partial reinvestment will therefore be focused on secondary market purchases. However, non-bank corporate issuers with a better climate performance and green corporate bonds will continue to be purchased in the primary market.
Finally, the Governing Council decided on a stronger tilting of its corporate bond purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance during the period of partial reinvestment. Without prejudice to the ECB’s price stability objective, and in keeping with the Governing Council’s climate action plan, this approach will support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

,"2 February 2023
The Governing Council will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to its 2% medium-term target. Accordingly, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and it expects to raise them further. In view of the underlying inflation pressures, the Governing Council intends to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at its next monetary policy meeting in March and it will then evaluate the subsequent path of its monetary policy. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. In any event, the Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.
The Governing Council today also decided on the modalities for reducing the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under the asset purchase programme (APP). As communicated in December, the APP portfolio will decline by €15 billion per month on average from the beginning of March until the end of June 2023, and the subsequent pace of portfolio reduction will be determined over time. Partial reinvestments will be conducted broadly in line with current practice. In particular, the remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP and, under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. For the Eurosystem’s corporate bond purchases, the remaining reinvestments will be tilted more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance. Without prejudice to the ECB’s price stability objective, this approach will support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The detailed modalities for reducing the APP holdings are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 3.00%, 3.25% and 2.50% respectively, with effect from 8 February 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP until the end of February 2023. Subsequently, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term. The Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

ECB details modalities to reduce Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under the asset purchase programme through partial reinvestment, broadly in line with current practice under full reinvestment
Governing Council decided on stronger tilting of corporate bond purchases during partial reinvestment, including in primary market, towards issuers with better climate performance
As communicated in December, from the beginning of March 2023, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions.
On the basis of the December decision, the Governing Council today decided on the detailed modalities for reducing the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under APP through the partial reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities.
During the period of partial reinvestment, the Eurosystem will retain the existing smooth reinvestment approach. The monthly redemptions under the APP between March and June 2023 will exceed the decided average run-off pace of €15 billion per month. Partial reinvestments in excess of €15 billion per month will ensure that the Eurosystem maintains a continuous market presence under the APP over this period.
The remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP, i.e. the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).
Under the PSPP, the allocation of the reinvestments across jurisdictions and over time will continue to follow current practice. Specifically, the remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. Reinvestments will be distributed over time to allow a regular and balanced market presence.
For the private sector programmes (ABSPP, CBPP3 and CSPP), primary market purchases will be phased out by the start of the partial reinvestments in order to better steer the amount of the purchases conducted under each programme. The Eurosystem’s market presence during the period of partial reinvestment will therefore be focused on secondary market purchases. However, non-bank corporate issuers with a better climate performance and green corporate bonds will continue to be purchased in the primary market.
Finally, the Governing Council decided on a stronger tilting of its corporate bond purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance during the period of partial reinvestment. Without prejudice to the ECB’s price stability objective, and in keeping with the Governing Council’s climate action plan, this approach will support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

,"Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 1-2 February 2023
2 March 2023
1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel noted that the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 14-15 December 2022 had left a visible footprint in euro area financial markets, with a welcome increase in real interest rates to levels that were more consistent with a timely return of inflation to the 2% target.
However, while the “terminal rate” priced in the euro area real overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had edged up initially, a sharp decline in expected inflation, on the back of lower gas prices and inflation surprises to the downside, had later contributed to market participants revising down their rate expectations. Expectations of rapid disinflation had also induced markets to price in material rate cuts as of 2024, suggesting that they judged the period of restrictive monetary policy needed to rein in high inflation to be relatively short.
These developments, alongside further signs of a more resilient euro area economy and the reopening of China’s economy, had boosted risk sentiment. Risk premia had declined measurably across market segments, compressing bond spreads and boosting equity prices, while the euro had appreciated further across the board as sentiment towards the euro area improved. However, the compression in risk premia was predicated on the markets’ firm conviction that inflation dynamics were on a steep and sustained downward trajectory towards 2%. A stronger persistence of underlying price pressures could lead to a reappraisal of the monetary policy outlook and a correction in asset prices, as suggested by the strong market reaction, during the week, to some higher than expected inflation prints.
Documenting the substantial changes in real interest rates that had occurred since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, it was noted that the euro area real OIS forward curve had shifted upwards, with the real two-year OIS rate having turned positive for the first time since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. The upward shift reflected the impact of the ECB’s December communication, as well as a decline in expected inflation that had been most pronounced over the near term. While the rise in real rates did not necessarily imply that rates were now restrictive, especially considering the uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate, it could, if persistent, mark the end of a long era of negative real interest rates.
Model-based analysis suggested that the decline in the market-based inflation outlook had two broad origins. First, after a long phase of upside surprises to inflation, some misses to the downside relative to expectations for euro area headline inflation had been observed since November. Second, there had been a substantial decline in gas prices, which had, at present, a much larger impact on inflation swap rates than in the past, at both the short and the long end of the inflation swap curve. This increased sensitivity to changes in gas prices may have contributed to an increasing disconnect between the market-implied inflation path and that of professional forecasters. Two factors raised doubt about the markets’ benign view of inflation. First, the growing signs that a technical recession in the euro area had become less likely. And second, the reopening of China’s economy.
As markets were seemingly discounting these risks to the inflation outlook, they also questioned whether the ECB would keep rates in restrictive territory for a sustained period. While the market-implied path for future short-term interest rates foresaw a further tightening over the short run, in line with the ECB’s December communication, it also envisaged a reversal as of 2024. The expected terminal rate in the euro area had initially shifted notably upwards in response to the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting. However, it had gradually fallen back as investors reappraised the inflation outlook. Furthermore, markets currently expected a significant number of rate cuts over the course of 2024. In other words, given that investors expected a fast and sustained return of inflation to 2%, they expected policy rates to remain at a restrictive level for only a short period of time.
Investors had also become more certain about the revised expected interest rate path. Implied volatility over a horizon of up to one year was now at its lowest since spring 2022, although it remained high from a historical perspective. The decline in interest rate volatility, however, masked important differences in the drivers of uncertainty, with model-based analysis suggesting that uncertainty about the ECB’s “reaction function” had increased, while inflation uncertainty had declined.
These developments were not confined to the euro area. Investors, globally, expected major central banks to cut their key policy rates this year or next, as headline inflation was expected to ease rapidly from high spot levels. In response to some first signs of a turning point in headline inflation, investors were signalling that they believed rate cuts would soon be needed. This was despite warnings from central bank officials around the world that interest rates would probably stay higher for longer than markets expected, since core inflation – as measured by excluding energy and food from the overall index – remained elevated. Overall, therefore, markets had taken a view that the global economy, including the euro area, was at an inflection point, with stronger growth and lower inflation than previously expected. Such positioning was putting market pricing at a considerable risk of correction should inflation prove more persistent.
This was also visible when looking at the significant impact of the global reappraisal of the inflation and interest rate outlook on broader financial markets. In fixed income markets, there had been a broad-based compression of risk premia. In euro area sovereign bond markets, spreads had fallen across jurisdictions, despite the ECB’s December announcement that the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio would start to decline as of March 2023 and expectations of a faster run-off as of the third quarter. In euro area corporate bond markets, spreads for non-financial corporate bonds were around 25% lower than late-October levels. The rally in financial markets, spurred by the prevailing disinflation narrative, had been especially pronounced in stock markets, with euro area equities, in particular, having made significant gains.
Fading risks of recession, amid lower gas prices, had also been a key driver behind the euro’s continued appreciation since the 14-15 December meeting. This appreciation had been broad-based against most major currencies, with the Japanese yen being a notable exception.
In this environment of a more positive risk sentiment, market functioning had also improved notably, as reflected in lower volatility and improved liquidity in euro area sovereign bond markets. This made a further positive contribution to investors’ risk absorption capacity. At the same time, the increase in public sector issuance had contributed to reducing collateral scarcity. German repo rates for non-general collateral had moved closer to the euro short-term rate (€STR) again, reducing the collateral premium.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Mr Lane observed that the world economy had further decelerated in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for both manufacturing and services output falling below the threshold of 50 at the end of 2022. Consistent with low activity, international trade had also slowed in the final quarter of 2022. Despite the deceleration, global growth projections had improved for 2023, owing partly to the relaxation of pandemic restrictions in China. The euro had continued to appreciate since the 14-15 December Governing Council meeting. In trade-weighted terms, the exchange rate had returned to the level observed at the beginning of 2022.
The slowdown in global demand, together with the unusually warm winter and effective gas saving measures, had led to a sharp decline in energy prices. European gas prices had fallen by around 50% since the December monetary policy meeting. According to the futures curve, they were expected to remain around present levels, easing concerns about storage levels for next winter. Oil prices had ticked up since the December meeting but remained significantly below mid-2022 levels. The sharply lower energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks could be interpreted as a partial reversal of the large negative supply shock that had been observed since 2021.
The euro area economy had slowed further in the fourth quarter of 2022 but had proved more resilient than expected in December. The PMI composite output indicator had risen above the threshold of 50 in January 2023, after falling well into contractionary territory last autumn. However, unlike services, manufacturing output was still below the threshold. Manufacturing was once again the principal drag on overall output, despite the continued easing in supply bottlenecks that had particularly benefited car production and sales. Strong demand for leisure activities, tourism and hospitality were cushioning the slowdown in services activity.
The latest round of the Commission’s household survey suggested that euro area households had revised their expectations on consumer prices 12-months ahead sharply downwards and their expectations on the economic situation upwards. The less pessimistic view on the economic situation also supported the improvement in their expectations on the financial situation and would help private consumption in the period ahead. These survey results supported the interpretation of a reversal of the negative supply shock.
Housing and business investment were clearly weakening, owing partly to tighter financing conditions. The Commission’s business survey had shown that supply constraints, rather than demand constraints, had so far been the strongest factor limiting production. In particular, shortages of material and equipment were constraining production in the capital goods sector. While output in this sector had been supported by the easing of supply bottlenecks and firms working through backlogs of orders, especially in the car industry, new orders remained weak. For the construction sector, the PMI for both output and new orders had been on a downward trend since early 2022.
Nonetheless, Mr Lane continued to expect that the economy would recover over the course of the year, on the back of a robust labour market, rising wages and fiscal support measures, as well as current headwinds fading away. If the favourable supply-side developments persisted, these would provide further support to the recovery in activity.
The decline in energy inflation had meant an improvement in the terms of trade. A significant drop in import price inflation had been followed by a less pronounced decline in export price inflation. This asymmetry in the price adjustment had led to a significant improvement in the euro area current account at the end of 2022.
The labour market continued to be resilient. The unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.6% in December, far below the pre-COVID level. The PMI for employment, which had declined from its very high mid-2021 level, was still firmly positive. This suggested that firms were continuing to increase their labour force. In terms of vacancies, the latest Indeed data (from online job matching portals in the five largest euro area countries and Ireland) indicated that there had been a slight decline, but the level remained very high.
Compared with December expectations, risks to the growth outlook had become more balanced. Russia’s war against Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up energy and food costs. There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy were to weaken more sharply than expected at present. Moreover, the recovery would face obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions. However, the adverse energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and, while the security of European gas supplies remained vulnerable to global supply risks, higher than usual gas inventories had reduced supply risks for next winter. Moreover, euro area companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment. This would support higher growth than currently expected.
HICP inflation had declined sharply from 10.6% in October to 9.2% in December, and further to 8.5% in January, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. The lower figures largely reflected the sizeable drop in energy price inflation. By contrast, food price inflation had increased to 14.1% (from 13.8% in December). As in December, HICP inflation excluding energy and food stood at 5.2% in January. However, there was some variation across the sub-categories, with the inflation rate for non-energy industrial goods rising to 6.9% (from 6.4%) and services inflation declining to 4.2% (from 4.4%). When measured in terms of “momentum”, defined as the annualised three-month-on-three-month percentage change in prices, the deceleration of inflation dynamics between December and January was notably stronger than suggested by the annual rates in these components.
The uncertainty surrounding Eurostat’s January flash HICP estimate was greater than usual, as it contained an estimate of the figure for Germany. In January there had also been the usual change in the HICP weights, reflecting changes in expenditures over the previous year. Across items, one of the most important changes was the increased weight of services, as households had returned to a more normal consumption profile.
Measures of underlying inflation continued to stand at high levels. However, those indicators that included an energy component saw a turnaround. In addition, the recent dynamics of core inflation showed that there had been a levelling-off of momentum.
Looking at the determinants of goods inflation, energy-sensitive items had continued to provide a strong contribution until December 2022. Looking ahead, the contribution of energy-sensitive items could be expected to decline. However, it was uncertain whether the pace of the reduction was likely to be symmetric to that of the increase. But the contribution of non-energy-sensitive items was increasing.
To reconcile the still increasing contribution of energy-sensitive items with the fall in energy costs, it was useful to look at pipeline pressures. Those pressures had declined for food inflation, in particular for international food commodity prices and for European farm gate prices. But the producer price index for processed food was still increasing, owing to long transmission lags. Similarly, for goods inflation, there had already been a significant decline in pipeline pressures for intermediate goods, but the producer price index for non-food consumer goods was still increasing. Still, the fast decline observed in pressures upstream in the production chain were expected to lead to lower retail prices, as had been the case in the United States.
Mr Lane reported that, in the latest round of the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey, firms had stated that input cost pressures had been easing, reflecting declines in energy costs as well as other input costs, and they were expecting input costs to continue to decline.
Moving to the inflationary pressures stemming from the housing sector, rent inflation had been picking up very gradually in the euro area during 2022. Housing-related expenses had increased strongly during 2022 but the pace had started to decelerate at the end of the year. Moreover, inflation in owner-occupied housing costs had started to ease in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting the acquisition component. Residential property price inflation in the euro area had eased substantially in the third quarter of 2022, falling to 6.8%, from 9.2% in the second quarter.
Measured wage growth was strengthening, as compensation for past high inflation was becoming the main theme in wage negotiations, but wage developments so far were broadly in line with the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. The ECB wage tracker, which had improved its representativeness with the inclusion of data for France, indicated that new contracts signed during 2022 and coming into effect in 2023 implied ongoing wage increases of around 5%. Similarly, according to the January wage expectations from the Corporate Telephone Survey, firms expected average wage growth of around 5% for 2023, which was similar to the rate expected in the October survey round. The Indeed wage tracker had shown some signs of a turnaround in the last two months of 2022.
Longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had edged down, with a more marked correction for 2023 and 2024. In the other direction, the 2023 and 2024 inflation projections from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had increased. However, longer-term expectations had been revised marginally down to 2.1%, whereas those from the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts were unchanged at 2%. Finally, the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey for December 2022 indicated a levelling-off of median inflation perceptions and one-year ahead inflation expectations, but continued to point to three-year ahead inflation remaining at around 3%.
Overall, the favourable supply-side developments, if these persisted, should help dampen inflation, including through the impact of lower energy prices on the cost structures of energy-intensive sectors in the goods and services categories and on the real wage gap. At the same time, the improvement in the terms of trade constituted a positive income and wealth shock that would also support demand.
The inflation outlook remained highly uncertain, although compared with the Governing Council’s expectations in December, the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced, especially in the near term. On the upside, existing pipeline pressures could still send retail prices higher in the near term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. Domestic factors, such as inflation expectations persistently above the ECB’s target or higher than anticipated wage rises, could drive inflation higher, also over the medium term. On the downside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persisted, might slow inflation more rapidly than expected. This downward pressure in the energy component could then also translate into weaker dynamics for underlying inflation. A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term. The net impact of the reopening of China’s economy on euro area inflation dynamics over the coming months was uncertain. While a strong rebound in Chinese production could further ease supply bottlenecks and increase competition in the global goods market, thus constituting a disinflationary impulse for the world economy, a recovery in Chinese demand could also add to inflationary pressures, especially through higher demand for commodities.
Turning to financial and monetary developments, bank funding costs continued to reflect the transmission of monetary policy. Euro area bank bond yields had increased somewhat further since the December Governing Council meeting, reflecting the movements in the key ECB interest rates and in market rates. Deposit rates had also increased further, rising more strongly for firms than for households since May 2022.
The spread between M3 savings deposits and overnight deposits had continued to widen, broadly in line with past rate hiking periods. Over time, this would likely lead to a considerable downward adjustment to the currently still high share of overnight deposit holdings, as currently there was an incentive to minimise deposit holdings in current accounts. Moreover, as the ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) were being repaid, banks needed some longer-term deposits to meet various regulatory ratios. Thus, there was an expectation that this portfolio switch would continue.
The increase in policy rates continued to be passed through to firms. The cost of debt financing had risen substantially since September 2022 and the strong increase in bank lending rates had led to a considerably narrower spread between the cost of market-based debt financing and the cost of bank borrowing at the end of 2022, compared with its September level.
The current pace of monetary policy tightening was faster than in previous rate hiking cycles, reflecting the greater frequency and size of policy rate hikes. However, as this represented a reversal of previous loosening and was a necessary normalisation to address high inflation, it was not viewed as a severe squeeze by the banks or their customers.
The transmission of monetary policy was also reflected in developments in bank lending conditions, as reported by banks in the latest bank lending survey. Banks continued to report a substantial net tightening of their credit standards on loans to firms and on loans to households for house purchase in the fourth quarter of 2022. Mr Lane noted that, since the survey was meant to assess the change in credit standards and not their level, it was legitimate to ask whether banks were tightening or just reversing a very accommodative set of credit standards. Still, as the tightening continued, at some point the trend would move beyond normalisation.
Demand for bank loans to non-financial corporations had also declined in the final quarter of 2022. This was driven mainly by rising interest rates, in line with the increase in bank lending rates for firms. The bank lending survey revealed that the decline in demand for loans stemmed, in particular, from the commercial real estate, residential real estate and construction sectors, the most interest rate-sensitive sectors. In addition, loan demand was being dampened by lower financing needs for fixed investment and a moderation in firms’ financing needs for working capital. The bank lending survey reported a steep drop in demand for housing loans, which was unprecedented in the history of the survey. The main drivers of this fall were rising interest rates, deteriorating prospects for housing markets and low consumer confidence.
Debt financing flows for firms had declined in November and December, owing to net redemptions in bank borrowing. There was therefore evidence of some deleveraging by firms at the end of 2022. Household borrowing dynamics had also weakened, driven mainly by developments in housing loans. The moderating trend in mortgage borrowing reflected tighter credit standards, rising lending rates and decreasing loan demand.
Finally, on monetary developments, Mr Lane reported that the deceleration in loan creation was reflected in a decline in money growth. The moderation in broad money (M3) growth was driven mainly by outflows from narrow money (M1), the growth of which had fallen markedly. Persistently low remuneration of overnight deposits meant that the opportunity costs of holding M1 instruments had risen significantly. Deposit flows continued to reflect the shifts towards time deposits and to M3 instruments offering a remuneration closely linked to market rates.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
Against this background, Mr Lane proposed raising the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and communicating that the Governing Council expected to raise them further. The Governing Council should stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. Accordingly, in view of the underlying inflation pressures, Mr Lane proposed communicating the intention to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at the next monetary policy meeting in March and to then evaluate the subsequent path of monetary policy. Signalling a 50 basis point step for the March meeting acknowledged that, in a very wide range of scenarios, the Governing Council saw that a further step of this size remained necessary to bring the key ECB interest rates to levels that would ensure a return of inflation to target in a timely manner. That said, looking beyond the immediate term, the monetary policy meeting in March would provide a waypoint at which to evaluate the subsequent path of monetary policy, including on the basis of a new set of staff macroeconomic projections that would then be available. The Governing Council would in this way ensure that its future policy rate decisions continued to be data-dependent and followed a meeting-by-meeting approach.
Regarding the parameters that would govern the measured and predictable reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio that had been decided in December, it was important that the process remained transparent, simple to understand and as neutral as possible vis-à-vis the pricing of the classes of securities held in the portfolio. To this end, Mr Lane proposed that the partial reinvestments be conducted broadly in line with current practice. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Governing Council should also support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
As regards the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the signalling power of the framework for PEPP reinvestment flexibility was still supporting the monetary policy transmission mechanism. It was therefore proposed, in the spirit of prudence, to continue to allow flexibility in PEPP reinvestments as an effective first line of defence against remaining fragmentation risks.
Ms Schnabel then detailed the proposal for the modalities to be followed in reducing the APP holdings, following the Governing Council’s decision at its December monetary policy meeting to reduce the APP portfolio by €15 billion per month on average from the beginning of March until the end of the second quarter of 2023. During the partial reinvestment phase, reinvestment amounts were expected to be relatively small. Any changes to the modalities would therefore have a very limited impact on the composition of the APP portfolio. This argued for keeping the modalities for the period of partial reinvestments simple, reflecting as much as possible the practice applied for full reinvestment. This approach would also preserve consistency with the overall monetary policy stance and market functioning, and should facilitate the Eurosystem’s public communication.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that subdued global economic activity and high levels of geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, continued to act as headwinds to euro area growth. Subdued global activity would weigh on global trade and euro area foreign demand, despite improvements in global supply chains. In their discussion, members argued that, on the one hand, the reopening of the Chinese economy should lead to fewer bottlenecks in global supply chains and thus support global activity. This would also imply stronger foreign demand for the euro area. On the other hand, the reopening of its economy would increase China’s appetite for commodities, including natural gas, and would make China a strong competitor of Europe for supplies of liquified natural gas. This would put upward pressure on European gas prices and act as a headwind to Europe’s recovery. Pressure on prices of other raw materials, such as metals, owing to increased demand from China, was already visible. Which of the various forces at play would eventually prevail was not clear, creating considerable uncertainty for the euro area outlook.
Members highlighted that energy commodity prices had come down significantly, in some cases returning to levels prevailing before the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This implied that the euro area’s import bill for fossil fuels would be reduced considerably. At the same time, it was mentioned that there was still considerable scepticism in energy markets about whether the current lower energy prices would persist. Part of the decline in prices seemed to be driven by the current mild winter weather, which would not necessarily be repeated next winter. It was widely stressed that the euro area continued to be confronted by an exceptionally high degree of global uncertainty, owing to both economic and geopolitical factors.
With regard to economic activity, despite the challenging external environment, members concurred with Mr Lane that the euro area was likely to avoid a recession. Together with high inflation and tighter financing conditions, global headwinds were dampening spending and production, especially in the manufacturing sector. However, in addition to easing supply bottlenecks and more secure gas supplies, firms were still working through large order backlogs and confidence was improving. Moreover, output in the services sector had been holding up, supported by the continuing effects of the reopening of the economy and stronger demand for leisure activities. Rising wages and the recent decline in energy price inflation were also set to ease the loss of purchasing power that many people had experienced owing to high inflation. This, in turn, would support consumption. Overall, the economy had proved more resilient than expected and should recover over the coming quarters. The unemployment rate had remained at a historical low of 6.6% in December 2022. However, the rate at which jobs were being created was seen as potentially slowing, with unemployment rising over the coming quarters.
Members commented on the surprising resilience of economic activity to date. The release of Eurostat’s preliminary flash estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 had surprised on the upside, which was regarded as good news, even if the figure had most likely been pushed up by volatile transactions in Irish intellectual property products. In combination with recent levels of inflation, which had been lower than expected, this stronger activity was seen as indicative of a partial reversal of the negative supply shocks that had shaped developments in the euro area economy over the past year. As a result, the euro area economy was now in a better situation than expected in December, and it was argued that recent developments were in line with a “soft landing” (with the economy slowing but avoiding a recession). In such circumstances, the Governing Council might be able to bring down inflation without overly large sacrifices in terms of economic activity. However, it was also maintained that, despite the better than expected economic news, the underlying economic situation had not fundamentally changed since the December meeting.
Members concurred that government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. In particular, as the energy crisis became less acute, it was important to start rolling these measures back promptly in line with the fall in energy prices and in a concerted manner. Any such measures falling short of these principles were likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU’s economic governance framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making the economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, could help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly.
Against this background, members assessed risks to the economic growth outlook as having become more balanced. Russia’s war in Ukraine continued to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected. Moreover, the recovery would face obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions. However, the energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and euro area companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment. This would support higher growth than currently expected.
With regard to price developments, members concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. Price pressures remained strong, partly because high energy costs were spreading throughout the economy. HICP inflation excluding energy and food, as a measure of core inflation, remained at 5.2% in January. Other indicators of underlying inflation were also still high. Although supply bottlenecks were gradually easing, their delayed effects were still pushing up goods price inflation. The same was true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while weakening, the effect of pent-up demand was still driving up prices, especially in the services sector.
Government measures to compensate households for high energy prices were, by contrast, dampening inflation in 2023. However, the scale of some of these measures depended on the evolution of energy prices and therefore their overall contribution to inflation was particularly uncertain, since they were expected to raise inflation once they expired. Market-based indicators suggested that energy prices were seen as being significantly lower over the current and coming years than had been expected at the time of the Governing Council’s December meeting. At the same time, wages were growing faster, supported by robust labour markets. However, recent data on wage dynamics had been in line with the December Eurosystem staff projections. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2% but warranted continued monitoring.
Members concurred with the view that, although the rate of headline inflation had slowed since October, inflation was still far too high. While the good news ought to be welcome, it was argued that the December assessment of the inflation outlook had not fundamentally changed. Core inflation was still at levels foreseen in December. Therefore, it was much too early to declare victory.
Attention was drawn to the fact that the inflation figures for the euro area’s largest economy had not been available in time to be included in Eurostat’s flash release for January. It was suggested that, in all likelihood, the final release would turn out to be somewhat higher for the euro area. In this context, it was underlined that core inflation had surprised slightly on the upside and remained unchanged from December, which was seen as the reason for the very muted market reaction to the lower than expected headline inflation figure for January. Since core inflation was often regarded as the “attractor” to which headline inflation would revert over the medium term, the latest inflation figures were not necessarily a welcome development overall. However, caution was expressed against focusing too much on measures of core inflation. Indeed, some elements of core inflation could move quite quickly, as seen from the experience in the United States and in line with the latest developments in euro area pipeline pressures. However, that would not necessarily imply that the more persistent elements of inflation, such as those related to wages, would turn around. It was recalled that the ECB monitored a wide array of measures of underlying inflation and undertook a detailed analysis of all components of headline inflation, rather than looking exclusively at particular measures of core inflation excluding several volatile items. Finally, it was mentioned that January inflation developments in Croatia, which had just joined the euro area, had been quite stable overall, compared with December. This suggested that the upward impact on prices from the cash changeover had been rather limited so far, contrary to the expectations of some people.
As regards developments in core inflation, it was stressed that the pass-through of lower energy prices to this measure was a key factor in the assessment of the lag with which the rate of core inflation would show convincing signs of a deceleration. In this context, members debated the extent to which lower energy prices would lead to a moderation in underlying price pressures. This would depend on whether the pass-through from declining energy prices to other components of inflation was symmetric to that observed when energy prices increased.
On the one hand, there were a number of reasons to believe that offsetting factors might lead to a slower pass-through of the disinflationary impulse than had been observed over the recent inflationary phase. In particular, the pass-through of earlier higher wholesale energy prices to retail prices took time and was still ongoing. Demand pressures had increased and wage pressures were rising on the back of wage negotiations that were being increasingly influenced by the high rates of current or past inflation and continued labour scarcity. In addition, the longer duration of wage contracts, rising minimum wages and staggered wage-setting could lead to a longer persistence of wage growth. In this respect, it was underlined that inflation pressures had been broadening for some time, so the driving force behind the inflation process was no longer a pure supply-side inflation shock. While the rise in inflation had started with a supply shock, it had turned into more of a demand-side type of inflation, making inflation more persistent. Moreover, there was evidence that the effect of an increase in energy prices on both GDP and inflation was very different from the effect of a decrease in energy prices, partly owing to downward price and wage rigidities. Recent evidence for the euro area showed that there was significant asymmetry, so the strong and fast pass-through observed as energy prices rose could not be expected to simply reverse swiftly as prices declined.
On the other hand, it was argued that the decline in energy prices could well be transmitted more quickly to items of core inflation, in line with how the inflationary shocks had filtered through to this measure in recent quarters as prices rose. This suggested that core inflation might over time decline faster than envisaged in the December projections. In any case, it was noted that it was too early to observe such a rapid pass-through, as non-energy industrial goods inflation was still increasing, suggesting that the upside pressures from past higher energy prices were still present. Staggered price adjustment implied that households and firms might face higher energy prices only after some time had elapsed, so while energy commodity prices were falling, households and firms would still see some of the pass-through from the previous increase in energy prices. At the same time, it had to be acknowledged that the rate of industrial producer price inflation, excluding energy, had significantly decelerated, which was an important indication that lower energy prices would at some point translate into lower core inflation. In this context, it was also argued that in the three-month-on-three-month changes in the HICP excluding energy and food – the core “momentum” – there were already initial signs that underlying inflation would start to decline in annual growth rates, despite the fact that core inflation naturally responded with a lag to changes in energy prices.
Members considered the implications of the reopening of China’s economy for inflation developments in the euro area. In this context, the remark was made that the reopening of a major global net-exporting economy, such as China, should on balance be expected to have a dampening impact on global price pressures, even if Chinese aggregate demand increased. Moreover, Chinese exporters could also be expected to lower their prices so as to regain some of the market share they had lost during the periods of lockdown, thus spurring price competition worldwide. However, upward pressures on inflation could be expected from an increase in Chinese demand, especially for commodities.
There was still considerable uncertainty about the dampening impact of tighter monetary policy on inflation. The current inflation dynamics most likely did not yet reflect recent monetary policy tightening. In fact, it was argued on the basis of recent survey evidence that current financing conditions were hardly restrictive enough to dampen demand sufficiently to bring inflation back to the ECB’s target in a timely manner. This suggested that the contribution of monetary policy to disinflation had been limited so far, except indirectly through the appreciation of the euro and through the housing market channel in a number of euro area economies. With regard to exchange rates, it was noted that the recent appreciation of the euro implied lower inflationary pressures for the euro area in the period ahead.
Members recalled that wage pressures were key in understanding the risks of second-round effects on inflation and in determining more persistent developments in underlying price pressures. Until a few months ago wage growth had remained moderate, but now there was a clear acceleration, which had to be taken into account in the outlook for core inflation. It was also highlighted that, despite the slowdown in economic activity, the labour market remained exceptionally tight. This meant that price pressures acting on labour-intensive services were unlikely to abate soon. The wage trackers were showing very strong wage increases under newly concluded contracts, which, in a context of the long durations of wage contracts and centralised wage bargaining, might lead to more persistent wage growth. However, it was also noted that wage growth for the pool of job movers should naturally be expected to be much higher than wage growth for job stayers, as the former were expected to account for the bulk of productivity growth. Following the pandemic, the economy was going through a period of intensified job churning, so it was natural that labour productivity and wage growth were accelerating. But this would not necessarily imply an increase in price pressures. At the same time, it was highlighted that the observed strong increase in minimum wages would add to existing wage pressures. There was evidence that, over time, increases in minimum wages could feed into wage increases further up the wage scale. Therefore, while there was wide agreement that there were no signs of a wage-price spiral, it was argued that current wage growth was clearly not consistent with a 2% inflation target, even when taking into account trend improvements in productivity.
In this context, it was reiterated that wages were a lagging indicator, so only the most recent phase of wage growth should be seen as fully reflecting past price increases. In some sectors and some countries, wages were expected to rise by more than 10%. However, it was also observed that there was a lot of heterogeneity across sectors and countries. Moreover, while wage negotiations were still ongoing, wage claims were hardly reliable early indicators for the final wage agreements, which more often than not tended to be more moderate. It was observed that some catch-up effect from the loss of purchasing power accumulated over the past few years would unavoidably exert upward pressure on wage growth, in line with the December staff projections. At the same time, as energy prices had started to decline again, the loss in real income was now lower than previously expected. This could imply that the push to recover purchasing power via higher wages would also diminish, while leading to stronger than expected aggregate demand. It was underlined that, so far, the association of fast-rising prices with lagging wages had implied a large shift in income from labour to capital. Developments in unit profit growth remained very strong, which suggested that the pass-through of higher costs to higher selling prices remained robust. It was therefore widely stressed that developments in profits and mark-up warranted constant monitoring and further analysis on an equal footing with developments in wages.
Members agreed that fiscal policies continued to play a crucial role in determining the degree of persistence of medium-term inflation. Several members were of the view that fiscal policy was working against monetary policy efforts to restore price stability. At the same time, some upward effects on inflation could be expected from the positive demand impact of fiscal policy – especially through the component of fiscal policy aimed at protecting consumers from a loss of purchasing power. Moreover, governments could be expected to refrain from providing additional support if there was a diminished need for it, because this was costly in budgetary terms.
As regards longer-term inflation expectations, members took note of the assessments by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane of the latest developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation and in survey-based indicators, concurring that they were broadly in line with longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored. Financial markets continued to see the Governing Council as credible in bringing inflation back to target. At the same time, it was argued that some indicators suggested longer-term inflation expectations remained at risk of becoming unanchored. Market-based expectations for near-term inflation had come down substantially, whereas medium and long-term inflation expectations remained broadly unchanged. Moreover, some survey-based measures had even increased. Median three-year ahead inflation expectations in the Consumer Expectations Survey for December had reversed their previous decline and again stood at 3%. The Survey of Professional Forecasters had reported upward revisions for 2023 and 2024, for both headline and core inflation, while long-term inflation expectations had declined slightly.
Against this background, members assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced, especially in the near term. On the upside, existing pipeline pressures could push retail prices higher in the near term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target or higher than anticipated wage rises, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. On the downside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persisted, might slow inflation more rapidly than expected. This downward pressure in the energy component could then translate into weaker dynamics in underlying inflation. A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. As monetary policy was tightened, bank lending rates for firms and households were rising. The growth of bank lending to firms had decelerated sharply over recent months. This partly stemmed from lower financing needs for inventories. But it also reflected weakening demand for loans to finance business investment, in the context of a steep upward move in bank lending rates and a considerable tightening in credit standards, as reported in the most recent euro area bank lending survey. Household borrowing had continued to weaken as well, reflecting rising lending rates, tighter credit standards and a sharp fall in the demand for mortgages. As the pace of loan creation was decelerating, money growth was also slowing rapidly, with a marked decline in the growth of its most liquid components, including overnight deposits, which was only partially compensated for by a shift to term deposits.
It was highlighted that the weakening in credit dynamics, with the growth of loans to firms in the euro area coming to a virtual standstill in November and December, was in large part a natural and desired consequence of the ongoing normalisation of the monetary policy stance. However, the size and speed of the recent decline had to be monitored, since it might act as a drag on the recovery. A question was raised as to the extent to which the weakening in lending dynamics was due to lower demand, which could be traced back to monetary policy tightening, or to supply factors. Reference was made in this respect to the results of the latest round of the bank lending survey. This pointed to reduced loan demand being driven mainly by a higher general level of interest rates and lower demand for fixed investment, while the tightening of lending standards was driven mainly by banks’ risk perception and risk tolerance, and less by the cost of funds. At the same time, it was remarked that euro area banks’ capital positions remained solid amid improving asset quality, despite challenging and quickly evolving macroeconomic and financial circumstances. Moreover, at the current stage of policy normalisation, banks saw their profitability boosted by increasing interest rate margins. Rising bank lending rates and lower lending volumes did not therefore necessarily reflect a reduction in banks’ intermediation capacity.
Looking beyond bank-based financing costs, members noted that broader financial conditions had tightened overall after the December meeting, reflecting the Governing Council’s policy decisions and communication. Market expectations for the terminal rate had risen to levels that were regarded as more comfortable and more consistent with a timely return of inflation to target. Notwithstanding the uncertainty about the precise level of the terminal rate, these expectations had been remarkably stable since December. Moreover, members welcomed the fact that real forward rates were now positive along the entire yield curve. It was underlined that debt financing conditions had tightened amid a benign situation in the bond market, in conjunction with receding uncertainty. In particular, bond spreads remained generally contained and risk assets, including equities, were performing strongly. In addition, the ECB’s announcement in December regarding the plans to reduce the APP portfolio from March 2023 had not resulted in a substantial increase in term premia or government bond spreads. Overall, despite some volatility, it was felt that the market response to the Governing Council’s communication following its December meeting could thus be deemed a success.
In view of recent monetary and financial developments, members noted that the transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions seemed to be working as intended and, so far, was broadly in line with previous hiking cycles. Given that transmission lags were long and variable – typically estimated to be around two years – it was argued that only a limited impact could be expected to be visible in demand and inflation at this point, at least if policy normalisation was assumed to have started in July 2022. However, it was suggested that December 2021, when the winding-down of asset purchases had been announced, could be a better starting point. This was when financing conditions had begun to tighten and mortgage rates had started to rise, well ahead of the time when policy rates were first raised. Accordingly, there had already been evidence for some time of a transmission of monetary policy to the housing market – which was welcome in view of the long-standing signs of overheating. Consumer loans and loans to non-financial corporations, by contrast, had seen little impact before the sharp deceleration in lending to firms observed in more recent months. As regards the extent to which financing conditions were constraining demand, reference was made to the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey. This suggested that larger firms continued to see financing conditions as favourable, with very few considering them a reason for reducing investment. Similarly, in the recent European Commission survey, financial constraints were not seen by firms as a significant factor limiting production. This was somewhat at odds with the results of the ECB’s bank lending survey, in which banks pointed to a significant negative contribution of interest rates to demand for loans.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members stressed that inflation remained far too high. However, the latest data implied that risks had become more balanced, with both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation having diminished relative to the Governing Council’s December assessment. Energy prices had declined rapidly, suggesting a partial reversal of the earlier adverse supply shock. If this development persisted, it should lead to a more rapid fall in headline inflation. It was also reiterated that, given the typically long transmission lags, the decline in headline inflation observed to date was unlikely to be the result of monetary policy tightening. At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation were likely to be stickier, with only limited evidence of a stabilisation so far.
Overall, it was widely argued that the latest data and the change in the balance of risks did not fundamentally alter the assessment made by the Governing Council in December, and there was a need to stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.
While members agreed that there were no signs of a wage-price spiral taking hold, wage pressures were broadening, in line with the December 2022 projections. On the whole, although there were already signs of a stabilisation and turning point in headline inflation, the pass-through to persistent components of inflation was highly uncertain. Underlying price pressures remained strong, inflation in non-energy components of the price index was rising and a tight labour market would continue to exert pressure on core inflation. Moreover, a better than expected growth outlook would contribute to continued inflationary pressures, which were unlikely to abate by themselves without further significant policy tightening.
In any case, it was argued on the basis of standard model elasticities that expected inflation for 2025 would now be closer to 2% than envisaged in the December 2022 projections, when taking into account the most recent data as well as changes in the external assumptions. These included higher market rates, a stronger euro in nominal effective terms and markedly lower energy prices. Beyond the impact of new data, members underlined the role of the change in market interest rate expectations, which had moved higher since the cut-off date for the December projections. At the same time, it was acknowledged that this was a partial analysis, and the strength and persistence of the various factors driving inflation required a full new round of projections to assess the implications for both the baseline outlook and the balance of risks. Uncertainty remained very high in any case, and it was unclear whether low energy prices would persist. Uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook stemmed particularly from the impact of China’s reopening, fiscal measures and the exchange rate on inflation. The next ECB staff projections would help shed more light on these questions and provide a more complete picture. It was remarked that basing the new staff projections on a yield curve that was more in line with members’ views should offer a better benchmark than the one provided by the projections available at the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting.
Attention was drawn to the gap between the inflation trajectory embedded in the December projections and that implied by financial markets. Market participants appeared to be more optimistic and had substantially reassessed their inflation outlook, with inflation-linked swap rates having come down significantly at short horizons. This raised the question of whether markets were giving too much weight to the decline in energy prices. In this context, it was seen as somewhat surprising that markets had hardly reacted to the flash estimate for euro area January headline inflation being lower than projected. At the same time, they had reacted strongly to the upside surprise in January headline inflation in the euro area’s fourth largest economy, which had also seen an acceleration in core inflation. This could indicate that markets were now paying more attention to core inflation than to headline inflation to gauge underlying inflationary pressures.
It was underlined that both survey and market-based indicators of inflation expectations at longer-term horizons remained broadly anchored, suggesting that the ECB was expected to be successful in bringing inflation down to 2% over the medium term. However, it was also pointed out that some survey-based measures of inflation expectations had been revised upwards, and that the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored had not disappeared.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Against this background, broad support was expressed for Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and to communicate that the Governing Council expected to raise them further, indicating specifically that it intended to raise rates by another 50 basis points at the next monetary policy meeting in March and would then evaluate the subsequent policy path. Indeed, further increases were required for the Governing Council’s policy rates to enter restrictive territory, and it was necessary to keep them at levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target.
Any assessment of what level of rates could be seen as excessively restrictive was complex and uncertain, although it was generally felt that concerns of “overtightening” were premature at the present high levels of inflation and in view of the likely persistence of underlying price pressures. It was emphasised that policy rates were, at present, barely consistent with the range of estimates for the neutral rate and that the large bond portfolio held by the Eurosystem was also still providing substantial policy accommodation. Moreover, even the benign inflation scenario expected by financial markets was conditional on the significant further rate increases priced into the forward curve.
Overall, it was seen as imperative to stay the course and to show determination in the intention to tighten further. This would reduce unwarranted policy uncertainty and would be fully consistent with the decisions and communication adopted by the Governing Council in December. The view was expressed that, given the still substantial distance to the prospective terminal rate, there continued to be value – from a risk management perspective – in frontloading rate hikes at the present stage. In particular, showing determination now to raise rates significantly further could help to avoid being forced into further rate hikes later on.
In this context, it was remarked that the risk-free forward curve suggested markets were expecting rate cuts not long after the terminal rate had been reached. This was seen to be somewhat at odds with the Governing Council’s communication in December that interest rates would need to stay at restrictive levels for inflation to return to the medium-term target. At the same time, this could be interpreted as markets having confidence that the ECB would be successful in stabilising inflation. In other words, once inflation had returned to target, interest rates could come down to a level consistent with the long-run “steady state”.
While there was broad agreement that tightening needed to continue, reservations were expressed on the proposed communication of an intention for the March meeting. The point was made that policy rates were coming closer to a level where caution was needed to ensure that monetary policy was not tightened excessively. In view of the high uncertainty, the inflation outlook could change rapidly in either direction. This required a careful assessment of new data and of the effect of previous rate hikes on price dynamics. Not least in view of the ECB’s symmetric inflation target, the risk of doing too much deserved as much consideration as the risk of doing too little. It was noted that the short-term momentum in core inflation had also started to decline somewhat and, allowing for transmission lags, core inflation should come down further over time. Moreover, at the start of policy normalisation, large buffers of savings accumulated by households and firms, together with substantial pent-up demand, had ensured that monetary policy could be tightened without causing much harm to the real economy. Although these buffers remained at high levels, they had diminished. This implied that more caution was required as regards further tightening steps.
The point was made that the proposed communication did not prevent adapting the intended change in the policy stance in March should it be required on the basis of substantial new information: expressing an “intention” was different from giving a “commitment”. It merely reflected the fact that, on the basis of the information available, the probability of a change occurring was seen as insignificant. It conveyed the view that, in the absence of abrupt changes in circumstances, a further 50 basis point interest rate hike at the March meeting was consistent with a very wide range of possible scenarios for the way inflation would develop. An advance indication of such a move would therefore provide clarity about the near-term direction of monetary policy. This reconciled communicating the intention to raise rates in March with a data-dependent approach.
All in all, it was seen as important to provide a firm signal of policy intentions for the March meeting, while stating that the path of monetary policy following that meeting would be evaluated with an open mind, in line with the data-dependent approach.
Turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, members widely agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal on the key parameters for the reduction of the APP portfolio and with the detailed operational modalities as described by Ms Schnabel and as set out in a dedicated ECB press release. In particular, given the relatively small reinvestment amounts expected, broad support was expressed among the members for a simple and neutral approach. This meant that the partial reinvestments over the period between March and the end of June would be conducted broadly in line with current practice. The remaining reinvestment amounts would be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP and, under the public sector purchase programme, proportionally to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. Just as the APP had supported the monetary policy stance when it was introduced, the reduction of the APP portfolio had to be carried out in a way that would support smooth policy normalisation and transmission, keeping the decline in the portfolio measured and predictable.
It was highlighted that tilting reinvestments in the corporate sector purchase programme portfolio more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance would signal the ECB’s continued commitment – without prejudice to the objective of price stability – to supporting the EU’s policies for achieving the climate goals of the Paris Agreement via a gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings.
Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio. M"

Substantial tightening in credit standards for all loan categories
Loan demand from firms decreased as interest rates continued to rise and financing needs for fixed investment fell
Demand for housing loans decreased strongly owing to rising interest rates, low consumer confidence and deteriorating housing market prospects
According to the January 2023 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened substantially further (net percentage of banks standing at 26%) in the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1). Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the net tightening in credit standards was the largest reported since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011. With regard to loans to households for house purchase and consumer credit and other lending to households, banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 21% and 17% respectively). Higher risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and industry or firm-specific situation, banks’ declining risk tolerance as well as higher cost of funds continued to have a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. In the first quarter of 2023 euro area banks expect a continued net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms. In addition, euro area banks expect another net tightening of credit standards for both housing loans and consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts – tightened for loans to firms and loans to households in the fourth quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, margins on riskier and average loans, collateral requirements and other terms and conditions had a tightening effect. For housing loans and consumer credit, the net tightening of terms and conditions was primarily due to a widening of margins on both average and riskier loans.
Banks reported a net decrease in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Banks indicated a significant negative contribution of the rising general level of interest rates to loan demand. In addition, fixed investment had a stronger dampening impact on loan demand. Banks reported a positive impact of inventories and working capital needs on demand for loans to firms, although its contribution was smaller than in the previous two quarters, which likely reflects the gradual easing of supply bottlenecks.
The decrease in net demand for housing loans was the strongest on record, while demand for consumer credit and other lending to households also decreased strongly in net terms, albeit to a lesser extent than for housing loans. The net decrease in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates, lower consumer confidence and deteriorating housing market prospects. In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decline in demand for loans to firms. For loans to households, banks expect a continued strong net decline in demand for the first quarter of 2023.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail funding and securitisation deteriorated moderately in the fourth quarter of 2022, while access to debt securities and money markets improved slightly. Euro area banks reported a strengthening of their capital position in 2022 in response to new regulatory or supervisory requirements, although to a smaller extent than in 2021. At the same time, supervisory or regulatory action had a net tightening impact on banks’ credit standards across all loan categories in 2022. In the second half of 2022, euro area banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios had a broadly neutral impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises and households, while they had a slight tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans to enterprises, and a broadly neutral impact on terms and conditions for loans to households. Euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises across the main economic sectors in the second half of 2022. In addition, banks reported a net decrease in the demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, while for the energy-intensive manufacturing sub-sector there was a small increase in demand.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the January 2023 survey relate to changes observed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the first quarter of 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The January 2023 survey round was conducted between 12 December 2022 and 10 January 2023. A total of 151 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 99%.

,"Introduction
The results reported in the January 2023 bank lending survey (BLS) relate to changes observed during the fourth quarter of 2022 and expectations for the first quarter of 2023. The survey was conducted between 12 December 2022 and 10 January 2023. A total of 151 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 99%. In addition to results for the euro area as a whole, this report also contains results for the four largest euro area countries.

A number of ad hoc questions were included in the January 2023 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of regulatory and supervisory requirements on banks’ lending policies, the impact of banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios on their lending policies and the change in bank lending conditions and loan demand across the main economic sectors.
1 Overview of results
In the January 2023 BLS, euro area banks reported a substantial further tightening of credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2022, i.e. the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was substantially larger than the percentage of banks reporting an easing. Risks related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ risk tolerance continued to have a tightening impact on credit standards. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also continued to have a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms, which was somewhat smaller for costs related to capital and market financing and slightly larger for the liquidity position of banks than in the previous quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a net tightening of a similar magnitude to the current quarter.
Firms’ net demand for loans declined, corresponding to the recently observed moderation in loan flows to non-financial corporations. The decline in net demand was stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter. Banks indicated a significantly negative contribution of the rising general level of interest rates to loan demand. In addition, fixed investment had a stronger dampening impact while inventories and working capital needs had a smaller positive impact on loan demand, compared with the previous quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decline in demand for loans to firms.
Banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and for consumer credit. The primary driver was higher risk perceptions and there was also a tightening contribution from the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, and decreasing risk tolerance, alongside a slight tightening impact from competition for housing loans. The decrease in loan demand by households for house purchase was the strongest recorded since the beginning of the survey in 2003. Demand also decreased at a lesser but still strong pace in net terms for consumer credit. The general level of interest rates, lower consumer confidence and housing market prospects all contributed negatively to demand for loans for house purchase. The general level of interest rates and lower consumer confidence also contributed to a net decrease in consumer credit demand alongside an increasingly negative contribution from lower demand for durables. In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect another net tightening of credit standards for all lending to households and a strong net decrease in housing loan and consumer credit.
In more detail, euro area banks reported a substantial further tightening of their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 26%, after 19% in Q3 2022; see Overview table). The net tightening of credit standards was broadly in line with banks’ expectations from the previous quarter. Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the net tightening of credit standards was the largest reported since the euro area sovereign debt crisis (net percentage of 35% reached in Q4 2011). Risks related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ declining risk tolerance continued to have a tightening impact on credit standards of similar magnitudes to the previous quarter. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also continued to have a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. The tightening contribution in this quarter compared with the previous one was somewhat smaller for costs related to capital and market financing and slightly larger for the liquidity position of banks, which corresponds to the substantial early repayments of central bank liquidity made in the fourth quarter, following the recalibration of the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a net tightening of similar magnitudes to the current quarter (24%).
Euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of banks of 21%, after 32% in Q3 2022; see Overview table), and a substantial but less pronounced net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (17%, after 21%). In both cases the tightening was smaller than anticipated in the previous quarter (net percentage of 32% and 20% respectively). The net tightening for housing loans was driven mainly by higher risk perceptions. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints as well as lower risk tolerance had a moderate tightening impact, while competition had a slight tightening impact. For consumer credit, increased risk perceptions mainly contributed to the net tightening, while decreased risk tolerance and the overall cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a slight tightening impact. Banks expect credit standards to tighten for both housing loans (16%) and for consumer credit (15%) in the first quarter of 2023.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened substantially (net percentage of 39%, after 19%). The widening of margins on both average (net percentage of 21%) and riskier loans (net percentage of 20%) had a significant tightening effect, while collateral requirements and other terms and conditions had a more moderate contribution. Banks also reported a net tightening of overall terms and conditions for both housing loans (net percentage of 29%, after 24%), and consumer credit and other lending to households (20%, after 22%). In contrast to the previous quarter, when loan margins narrowed on both loans for house purchase and consumer credit (despite the net tightening of terms and conditions), loan margins widened across both categories of lending, pointing in part to a more pronounced pass-through of policy rate increases.
Banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 12%, after 8%). For housing loans, banks reported a lower but still strong net increase in the share of rejected applications compared with the previous quarter (25%, after 31%). The share of rejected applications also increased in net terms for consumer credit (20%, after 13%).
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in net terms in all four largest euro area countries in the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Overview table). Credit standards for housing loans also tightened across all four largest euro area countries, while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households were unchanged in Italy and tightened in Germany, Spain and France.
Firms’ net demand for loans decreased in the fourth quarter of 2022 (net percentage of -11%, after 13% in Q3 2022; see Overview table). This is the first decline in net demand since the beginning of 2021 and is more pronounced in comparison with banks’ expectations from the previous quarter. The reported net decline is consistent with the lower realised loan flows to non-financial corporations observed in the latest available data for the fourth quarter of 2022. Banks indicated a significant negative contribution of the rising general level of interest rates to loan demand (net percentage of -26%). In addition, fixed investment had a further strong dampening impact on loan demand (net percentage of -25%). While sentiment indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed some improvement in business activity for December, a slowdown in investment is still expected in the coming months. As firms continue to face elevated energy and production costs, banks also reported a positive impact of inventories and working capital needs (net percentage of 16%) on demand for loan to firms, although its contribution was smaller than in the previous two quarters, which likely reflects the gradual easing of supply bottlenecks. Loan demand decreased in net terms for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms, and for long-term loans, while it remained broadly unchanged for short-term loans. In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -15%), due to a significant decrease in demand for long-term loans, while the demand for short-term loans is expected to increase to a small extent.
Net demand by households for housing loans decreased at its largest rate on record (net percentage of -74%, after -42% in Q3 2022; see Overview table). Demand for consumer credit also decreased strongly, albeit to a lesser extent than for housing loans in net terms (net percentage of -29%, after -11%, see Overview table). The net decrease in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates (net percentage of -77%), consumer confidence (-54%) and housing market prospects (-50%). This highlights a strong negative impact of recent interest rate increases on housing loan demand, coupled with declining consumer confidence. The net decrease in demand for consumer credit was also mainly driven by the general level of interest rates (net percentage of -37%) and lower consumer confidence (-34%), while consumption of durables had a more pronounced negative contribution compared with the previous quarter (-26% after -6%). For the first quarter of 2023, banks expect net declines in the demand for housing loans (-49%) and for consumer credit (-20%).
Banks reported on balance a net decrease in demand for loans to enterprises in Germany, while loan demand increased in Spain and France and was unchanged in Italy in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net demand for both housing loans and consumer credit decreased in all four largest euro area countries. In particular, banks in Germany and France reported a very large net decrease in demand for loans for house purchase (-93% and -90% respectively).
Overview table
Latest BLS results for the largest euro area countries
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards or an increase in loan demand)
Notes: “Avg.” refers to historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.
The January 2023 BLS also contained a number of ad hoc questions. Euro area banks reported that their access to retail funding and securitisation deteriorated moderately in the fourth quarter of 2022, while access to debt securities and money markets improved to a small extent. In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect a deterioration in access to all funding sources.
Euro area banks reported a strengthening of their capital position in 2022 in response to new regulatory or supervisory requirements, although to a smaller extent than in 2021. At the euro area level, supervisory or regulatory action had a net tightening impact on banks’ credit standards across all loan categories in 2022, to a larger extent than previously reported. Looking ahead to 2023, euro area banks expect that regulatory or supervisory action will support their capital positions and will lead to a further tightening impact for credit standards and credit margins across all loan categories.
In the second half of 2022, euro area banks’ NPL ratios had a broadly neutral impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises and households. They had a slight tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans to enterprises, and a broadly neutral impact on terms and conditions for loans to households. Over the next six months, euro area banks expect NPL ratios to have a tightening impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to enterprises, housing loans and consumer credit, albeit to varying degrees of magnitude. Pressure related to supervisory or regulatory requirements, access to market financing and banks’ liquidity positions contributed towards an easing impact of NPL ratios on lending conditions in the second half of 2022, although costs of capital and lower risk tolerance had a tightening impact through NPL ratios.
Euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises across all the main economic sectors in the second half of 2022. These developments are in line with the substantial net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. Over the next six months, euro area banks expect a net tightening of credit standards across all main sectors of economic activity. Banks reported a net decrease in the demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, while in energy-intensive manufacturing there was a small increase in demand. Over the next six months, euro area banks expect a more pronounced decline in net demand in the real estate and construction sectors, while the decline is expected to be more moderate in manufacturing, services and retail and wholesale trade.

General notes
The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 151 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.

BLS questionnaire
The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e. domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat, or (5) eased/increased considerably.
In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).
Aggregation of banks’ replies to national and euro area BLS results
The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.
In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.
[

]
For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.
In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares in lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.
BLS indicators
Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e. they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.
[
4
]
The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.
A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).
Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e. an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.
In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.
In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.
Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via the Statistical Data Warehouse.
A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on the ECB's website.
2 Developments in credit standards, terms and conditions, and net demand for loans in the euro area
2.1 Loans to enterprises
2.1.1 Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened substantially
Euro area banks reported a substantial further tightening of credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2022, i.e. the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was substantially larger than the percentage of banks reporting an easing (net percentage of banks of 26%, after 19% in the third quarter of 2022; see Chart 1 and Overview table). The net tightening of credit standards was broadly in line with banks’ expectations from the previous quarter. Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the net tightening of credit standards was the largest reported since the euro area sovereign debt crisis (net percentage of 35% reached in Q4 2011). Credit standards tightened to the same extent for loans to SMEs (21%, after 19%) and for loans to large firms (21%, after 17%; see Chart 2). At the same time, the tightening was stronger for long-term loans (26%, after 20%) than for short-term loans (18%, after 15%).
Risks related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ declining risk tolerance continued to have the largest tightening impact on credit standards (see Chart 1 and Table 1). In addition, risks related to the collateral demanded had a small tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. Compared with the previous quarter, this was somewhat smaller for costs related to capital and market financing and slightly larger for the liquidity position of banks, which corresponds to substantial repayments of central bank liquidity in the fourth quarter, following the recalibration of the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a tightening impact for loans to both SMEs and large firms.

(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Chart 2
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened across all four largest euro area countries, driven mainly by banks’ higher perceived risks. In addition, banks in Germany, Spain and Italy reported a tightening impact of their risk tolerance on credit standards for loans to firms. Costs of funds and balance sheet conditions had a tightening impact across all four largest euro area countries, driven by banks’ capital position in Germany and Italy, the ability to access market financing in Spain and banks’ liquidity position in France.
In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms of a similar magnitude to the current quarter (24%). Banks expect a net tightening both for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 24%) and large enterprises (net percentage of 20%).
Table 1
Factors contributing to changes in credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
2.1.2 Terms and conditions on loans to enterprises tightened substantially
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened substantially in the fourth quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 39%, after 19%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). Tighter terms and conditions are confirmed by the steep rise in aggregate cost of borrowing for firms for the latest available data for the fourth quarter of 2022. The tightening in terms and conditions was mainly due to a widening of margins (defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) on both average (net percentage of 21%) and riskier (net percentage of 20%) loans, which was much more pronounced than in the previous quarter. Collateral requirements (net percentage of 8%) and other terms and conditions also had a tightening impact on firms’ overall terms and conditions. Banks reported a strong net tightening of overall terms and conditions both for loans to SMEs and large firms, owing mostly to the widening of margins on average and riskier loans (see Chart 4). Collateral requirements and other terms and conditions also had a tightening impact on overall terms and conditions across both loan categories.

(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Note: See the notes to Chart 3.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions, decreased risk tolerance and increased funding costs and balance sheet constraints were the main drivers of the net tightening in overall terms and conditions for loans to firms in the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Table 3). Risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of firms had a large tightening impact on terms and conditions, whereas the impact of the collateral demanded was more moderate. Banks indicated a further tightening effect of cost of funds and balance sheet constraints related to access to market financing, their capital costs and their liquidity positions. Competition had a small tightening impact on overall terms and conditions, related to competition from market financing and competition from non-banks.

(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. See the notes to Chart 1.
In all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions tightened on loans or credit lines to enterprises. Costs of funds and risk perceptions had a tightening impact on overall terms and conditions across all four largest economies. At the same time, banks’ risk tolerance had a tightening impact in Germany, Spain and Italy and a neutral impact in France. Competition related to market financing and non-banks had a tightening impact on overall terms and conditions in France and Italy. Banks in France indicated a widening of margins on average loans while margins were unchanged for riskier loans. Margins widened for both average and riskier loans in Germany, Spain and Italy.
2.1.3 Rejection rate for loans to enterprises increased
Euro area banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 12%, after 8% in the previous quarter). This development is consistent with a further tightening of credit standards, which makes banks more likely to reject loan applications. The net increase in the share of rejected loan applications was similar for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 11%, after 8%) and for loans to large firms (net percentage of 10%, after 9%).
Across the largest euro area countries, banks reported that in net terms the share of rejected loan applications increased in all four largest euro area countries. This was driven by an increase in the share of rejected applications both for SMEs and large firms in Germany and Spain, whereas in France and Italy the rejection rate increased for loans to large enterprises and remained unchanged for loans to SMEs.
2.1.4 Net demand for loans to enterprises decreased
According to euro area banks, firms’ net demand for loans decreased in the fourth quarter of 2022 (net percentage of -11%, after 13% in Q3 2022; see Chart 5). This is the first net decline in demand since the beginning of 2021 and is more pronounced compared with banks’ expectations from the previous quarter. The reported net decline is consistent with the lower realised loan flows to non-financial corporations observed in the available data for the fourth quarter of 2022. Loan demand decreased in net terms for SMEs (net percentage of -17%, see Chart 6) and large firms (net percentage of -11%) as well as for long-term loans (net percentage of -19%), while it remained broadly unchanged for short-term loans (net percentage of -1%).
Chart 5
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.
Chart 6
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 5. Developments in the factors having an impact on loan demand across firm sizes were added in the April 2022 survey round.
Banks indicated a significant negative contribution of the rising general level of interest rates to loan demand (net percentage of -24%, see Chart 5 and Table 4). In addition, fixed investment had a further dampening impact on loan demand (net percentage -25%). While sentiment indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed some improvement in business activity for December, a slowdown in investment is still expected in the coming months. As firms continue to face elevated energy and production costs, banks also reported a positive impact of inventories and working capital needs (net percentage of 16%) on demand for loan to firms. However, its contribution was smaller than in the previous two quarters, which likely reflects the gradual easing of supply bottlenecks in the last quarter of 2022, as captured by changes in the PMI delivery times indicator. The use of alternative financing related to debt security issuance and loans from non-banks had a positive impact (net percentage of 5% and 3% respectively) on loan demand, indicating that with the increase in market rates, banks substituted away from alternative sources of financing towards bank loans. In addition, other financing needs related to mergers and acquisitions (net percentage of -6%) had a dampening impact on demand, while debt restructuring (net percentage of 3%) supported loan demand to a small extent. For both SMEs and large firms, the general level of interest rates and firms’ financing needs related to fixed investment had a dampening impact on demand, while inventories and working capital had a positive, but smaller contribution as compared with the previous quarter (see Chart 6). In addition, other financing needs related to mergers and acquisitions had a dampening impact on loan demand for both SMEs and large firms.
Table 4
Factors contributing to changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 5.
In the largest euro area countries, banks reported a net decrease in demand for loans to firms in Germany, while loan demand increased in Spain and France and was unchanged in Italy. The general level of interest rates had a negative effect on loan demand in Germany, Spain and Italy, and a neutral effect in France. Financing needs related to fixed investment had a negative contribution to demand across all four large countries, while financing needs related to inventories and working capital had a positive impact on loan demand. Banks in France and Spain indicated that other financing needs related to debt refinancing and restructuring had a positive impact on loan demand, while other financing needs related to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) had a negative impact on loan demand in Germany and Italy. In Italy, other financing needs related to debt refinancing and restructuring also had a dampening impact on loan demand. In Germany, Spain and France, the positive impact of the alternative sources of financing on loan demand was related to debt security issuance. In addition, internal financing in Germany and loans from non-banks in France also had a positive impact on loan demand. In Italy, the negative impact of alternative financing was driven by internal financing and loans from non-banks.
In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -15%), due to a significant decrease in demand for long-term loans (net percentage of -29%). At the same time, the demand for short-term loans is expected to increase to a small extent (net percentage of 5%). Net demand for loans to large firms is expected to decrease more significantly (net percentage of -15%) in comparison with the fall in net demand expected for loans to SMEs (net percentage of -8%).
2.2 Loans to households for house purchase
2.2.1 Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened strongly
In the fourth quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of banks at 21%, after 32% in 2022 Q2; see Chart 7 and Overview table), which, however, was less pronounced than expected in the previous quarter (32%).
Chart 7
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “housing market prospects, including expected house price developments” and “borrower’s creditworthiness”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Banks’ increased risk perceptions primarily drove the observed tightening, while lower risk tolerance and higher cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed moderately to the net tightening (see Chart 7 and Table 5). Banks reported a similar tightening impact from increased risk perceptions compared with the previous quarter, stemming from concerns regarding the general economic outlook, borrower creditworthiness and housing market prospects. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of both risk perceptions and risk tolerance having a tightening impact. There was also a moderate tightening impact from banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints. Other country-specific factors also contributed moderately to the net tightening.
[

]
At the same time, pressure from competition from other banks had a slight tightening impact.
Across all four largest euro area countries, credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened in net terms. Some banks in France noted that the usury rate (a maximum interest rate on loans) had contributed towards a tightening.
[

]
Across all four largest euro area countries, increased risk perceptions and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a tightening impact, while competition had a neutral impact. Decreased risk tolerance had a tightening impact in Spain and Italy, but a neutral effect in Germany and France.
In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks again expect a net tightening of credit standards on loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of 16%).
Table 5

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 7.
2.2.2 Terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase tightened strongly
Banks reported a strong net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the substantial increase in euro area mortgage interest rates since the beginning of 2022 (net percentage of 29%, after 24% in the previous quarter; see Chart 8 and Table 6). The net tightening is primarily driven by widening margins on both average and riskier loans. This contrasts with previous quarters, in which loan margins narrowed due to relevant market reference rates rising faster than interest rates charged on housing loans. In addition, there was a net tightening of loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and a moderate net tightening of other loan size limits (part of other terms and conditions in Chart 8, left-hand side) alongside a slight moderate tightening contribution from increased collateral requirements and loan maturity limits. Non-interest rate charges were broadly unchanged.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “loan-to-value ratio”, “other loan size limits”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Table 6
Changes in terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 8.
Banks’ higher cost of funds and balance sheet constraints as well as increased risk perceptions made the strongest contributions to the net tightening of overall terms and conditions, alongside a smaller contribution from decreasing risk tolerance (see Table 7). Higher market interest rates are feeding into banks’ cost of funds, while increased risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance reflect broader economic risks. Competition had a broadly neutral impact on terms and conditions.
In all four largest euro area economies, overall terms and conditions for housing loans tightened in net terms. However, loan margins continued to contract in France on both average and riskier loans because the interest rate on loans had not risen as quickly as market reference rates, in part owing to the usury rate (see footnote 5). Loan margins widened for both average and riskier loans in Germany and Spain, while loan margins widened for average loans in Italy, but were unchanged for riskier loans. German banks also reported a tightening of LTV ratios, loan maturities, non-interest rate charges and other loan size limits. French and Italian banks both reported tighter LTV ratios and other loan size limits, while Italian banks also reported tighter loan maturity limits. Banks in all four largest euro area countries reported that cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a net tightening effect. Higher risk perceptions and a lower risk tolerance had a tightening impact in Germany, Italy and Spain and no impact in France, while pressure from competition had an easing impact in Spain, and no impact in the other three largest economies.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.2.3 Rejection rate for housing loans increased markedly
In the fourth quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a marked net increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for housing loans, which, however, was lower than in the previous quarter (25%, after 31%). This reflects the tightening of credit standards and the pressure on households’ debt servicing capacity from the higher cost of living and rising interest rates. The share of rejected loan applications increased in all four largest euro area countries.
2.2.4 Net demand for housing loans decreased substantially
Banks reported a substantial decrease in net demand for housing loans (net percentage of banks of -74%, after -42% in the third quarter of 2022; see Chart 9 and Overview table), which is the largest recorded decrease since the beginning of the survey.
Chart 9
Changes in demand for loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation” and “regulatory and fiscal regime of housing markets”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal finance of house purchase out of savings/down payment”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”.
Rising interest rates, declining consumer confidence and housing market prospects all contributed strongly towards this substantial fall in demand (see Chart 9 and Table 8). Together, these factors reflect the current environment of lower consumer confidence and economic slowdown, alongside increasing interest rates in response to high inflation. Additionally, this marks the second consecutive quarter in which housing market prospects contributed negatively to demand, for the first time since 2013. This is consistent with the recently observed slowdown in the rate of growth of house prices in the euro area. Other financing needs and the use of alternative finance also had a smaller negative contribution to demand.
Banks in all four largest euro area countries reported a net decrease in demand for housing loans. The fall was particularly pronounced in Germany and France, where the net percentage of banks reporting a decrease was 93% and 90% respectively. Declining consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates had a strong downward impact across all four countries. Housing market prospects had a noteworthy negative effect on demand in France and Germany, a smaller negative impact in Italy and no impact in Spain.
In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect another strong net decline in the demand for housing loans (net percentage of banks of -49%).

Note: See the notes to Chart 9.
2.3 Consumer credit and other lending to households
2.3.1 Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened substantially
Banks reported a substantial net tightening of credit standards on consumer credit and other lending to households in the fourth quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 17% after 21% in 2022 Q3; see Chart 10 and Overview table). This is slightly less than expected in the previous quarter (20%).
Banks’ increased risk perceptions mainly contributed to the net tightening of credit standards (see Chart 10 and Table 9). This was mostly related to perceptions regarding the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of consumers, although the risk related to the collateral demanded also had a moderate tightening effect. Decreased risk tolerance and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a smaller tightening effect while competition had a broadly neutral effect.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms in Germany, Spain and France, and were unchanged on balance in Italy. Increased risk perceptions and the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a tightening impact in all the largest countries. Changes in risk tolerance contributed towards the tightening observed in Spain and Germany but had no impact in France and Italy. Italian banks reported a small easing effect owing to competition.
In the first quarter of 2023, euro area banks again expect a net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 15%).

Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “creditworthiness of consumers” and “risk on the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.

Note: See the notes to Chart 10.
2.3.2 Terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households tightened
Banks’ overall terms and conditions applied when granting consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms (net percentage of 20%, after 22% in the previous quarter; see Chart 11 and Table 10). In contrast to the previous quarter, margins on both average and riskier loans widened.
Chart 11
Changes in terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “size of the loan”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions contributed most to the net tightening of terms and conditions (net percentage of 17%, see Table 11). Increased risk perceptions and declining risk tolerance also had a tightening impact on overall terms and conditions, while competition had a slight easing impact.
Across all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms. Despite the tightening of overall terms and conditions, loan margins narrowed on average loans in France and on riskier loans in Italy, while loan margins widened in Germany and Spain for both average and riskier loans. Across all four countries, cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a tightening impact, while increased risk perceptions had a tightening impact in Germany, Spain and France, but a neutral impact in Italy. Pressure from competition had an easing impact in Spain and Germany and a tightening impact in Italy. Banks’ risk tolerance had a tightening impact in Germany and Spain but a neutral impact in France and Italy.

Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.3.3 Rejection rate for consumer credit and other lending to households increased
Euro area banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for consumer credit and other lending to households (20%, after 13% in the previous survey round). Across the largest euro area countries, the rejection rate increased on balance in Germany, France and Italy, but was unchanged in Spain.
2.3.4 Net demand for consumer credit and other lending to households decreased strongly
In the fourth quarter of 2022, banks reported a strong net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of banks at -29%, after -11% in the previous quarter; see Chart 12 and Overview table). This decline was greater than prior expectations (-17%).
Chart 12
Changes in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing out of savings”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”. “Consumption exp. (real estate)” denotes “consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans”.
The general level of interest rates, declining consumer confidence and lower consumption of durables primarily contributed towards this net fall in demand (see Chart 12 and Table 12). All three factors contributed more towards the fall in demand than in the previous quarter.
Across all four largest euro area countries, a net decrease in demand was reported. The general level of interest rates and lower consumer confidence contributed negatively towards demand in all four countries, while consumption of durables had a negative impact in Germany, France and Italy.
In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect demand for consumer credit and other lending to households to decrease (net percentage of -20%).

3 Ad hoc questions
3.1 Banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding
The January 2023 survey included a question asking banks to assess the extent to which the situation in financial markets affected their access to retail and wholesale funding.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, banks reported that their access to retail funding and securitisation deteriorated moderately (see Chart 13 and Table 13). The deterioration in access to retail funding is in line with the increase in deposit rates up to November (the last available data point). Access to debt securities and money markets improved to a small extent. For money markets, this was solely driven by a small improvement in access to very short-term money markets. For debt securities, access to short-term securities improved somewhat, while access to medium-to-long-term debt securities deteriorated slightly. In addition, this contrasts with the strong deterioration in access to debt securities reported in recent quarters.
Chart 13
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)
Note: The net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “deteriorated considerably” and “deteriorated somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Table 13
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)
Note: See the notes to Chart 13.
In the first quarter of 2023 euro area banks expect, on balance, a generally moderate deterioration in their access to both retail and market funding, reflecting expectations of further increases in the ECB’s key policy interest rates.
3.2 Banks’ adjustment to regulatory and supervisory action
The January 2023 BLS questionnaire included an annual
[
7
]
ad hoc question to assess the extent to which new regulatory or supervisory requirements affected banks’ lending policies via the potential impact on their capital, leverage, liquidity position or provisioning and the credit conditions that they apply to loans. These new requirements cover regulatory or supervisory action that has been implemented recently or that is expected to be implemented in the near future. Furthermore, banks were also asked to indicate the effects on their funding conditions.
Chart 14
Impact of regulatory or supervisory action on banks’ risk-weighted assets, capital and funding conditions
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: For “total assets”, “risk-weighted assets” and “capital”, the net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages for “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. For “banks’ funding conditions”, the net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “experienced a considerable tightening” and “experienced a moderate tightening” and the sum of the percentages for “experienced a moderate easing” and “experienced a considerable easing”. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Euro area banks reported a strengthening of their capital position in 2022 in response to new regulatory or supervisory requirements (see Chart 14 and Table 14), albeit to a lesser extent than in 2021. Developments in banks’ capital position were driven more by retained earnings than by capital issuance. Banks indicated that regulatory or supervisory measures had a positive impact on banks’ total assets, while liquid assets remained broadly unchanged. Risk-weighted assets remained broadly unchanged in the context of regulatory and supervisory requirements, explained by unchanged average loans. At the same time, banks indicated that regulatory or supervisory action had a small tightening impact on their funding conditions.
Table 14
Impact of regulatory or supervisory action on banks’ risk-weighted assets, capital and funding conditions
(net percentages)
Note: See the notes to Chart 14.
Supervisory or regulatory action had a net tightening impact on banks’ credit standards and credit margins across all loan categories in 2022 (see Chart 15 and Table 15). The net tightening impact was stronger across all loan categories than in the previous two years.
Chart 15
Contribution of regulatory or supervisory action to the tightening of banks’ credit standards and margins
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Looking ahead to 2023, euro area banks expect regulatory or supervisory action to support their capital positions and lead to a small increase in their total assets while they expect a broadly unchanged impact on their risk-weighted assets. In addition, for their funding conditions, banks expect a net tightening impact, stronger than the impact for 2022. Banks also expect regulatory or supervisory action will have a tightening impact for credit standards and credit margins across all loan categories.
Table 15
Contribution of regulatory or supervisory action to the tightening of banks’ credit standards and margins
(net percentages)
Note: See the notes to Chart 15.
3.3 The impact of banks’ NPL ratios on their lending policies
The January 2023 survey questionnaire included a biannual ad hoc question on the impact of banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios on changes in their lending policies and the factors through which NPL ratios contributed to changes in their lending policies. Banks were asked about the impact on loans to enterprises, loans to households for house purchase and on consumer credit and other lending to households over the past six months and over the next six months.
Euro area banks reported a broadly neutral impact of NPL ratios on credit standards for loans to enterprises in the second half of 2022 (net percentage of 1%, after 2% in the first half of 2022, see Chart 16), a neutral impact for loans to households for house purchase (0% after 0%) and a broadly neutral impact for consumer credit and other lending (-1% after -2%). Banks reported that NPL ratios had a slight tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans for enterprise (2%, see Chart 16) and a broadly neutral impact for housing loans and consumer credit (1% and -1% respectively).
Banks referred to supervisory requirements, access to market financing and their liquidity positions contributing to a slight net easing impact of NPL ratios on lending conditions in the second half of 2022 (see Chart 17). On the other hand, costs of capital and declining risk tolerance contributed to a slight tightening impact of NPL ratios on lending conditions.
Chart 16
Impact of banks’ NPL ratios on credit standards and terms and conditions
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The NPL ratio is defined as the stock of gross NPLs on a bank’s balance sheet as a percentage of the gross carrying amount of loans. Changes in credit standards and/or terms and conditions can be caused by changes to the NPL ratio or by changes to regulations or the bank’s assessment of the level of the NPL ratio. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “contributed considerably to tightening” and “contributed somewhat to tightening” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “contributed somewhat to easing” and “contributed considerably to easing”. The dashed bars denote expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Over the next six months, euro area banks expect NPL ratios to have a tightening impact on both credit standards and terms and conditions for all categories of loans. Increased risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance are the primary drivers of this expected tightening through NPL ratios, while costs of capital, cost of balance sheet clean-up, pressure from supervisory requirements and access to market financing are expected to have relatively smaller tightening contributions through NPL ratios.
Chart 17
Contributions of factors through which NPL ratios affect banks’ policies on lending to enterprises and households
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 16.
3.4 Bank lending conditions and loan demand across main sectors of economic activity
The January 2023 survey questionnaire included a biannual ad hoc question to collect information on changes in banks’ credit standards, overall terms and conditions and loan demand across the main economic sectors over the past and next six months. Banks were asked to report information covering five sectors: manufacturing, construction (excluding real estate), services (excluding financial services and real estate), wholesale and retail trade, and real estate (including both real estate construction and real estate services). Starting from this survey round, a sub-category of the manufacturing sector – energy-intensive manufacturing – has been added.
Euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises across all the main economic sectors in the second half of 2022 (see Chart 18). These developments are in line with the substantial net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. Across the main sectors of economic activity, credit standards tightened in manufacturing (17%, after 2%), with the tightening being particularly strong for energy-intensive manufacturing (30%). In the second half of 2022, the tightening of credit standards was also more pronounced in commercial (25%, after 17%) and residential real estate (21%, after 16%), construction (16%, after 9%) and wholesale and retail trade (14%, after 8%) when compared with the first half of 2022. After no change in the credit standards for loans in the services sector had been reported in the first half of 2022, there was a moderate tightening (6%, after 0%) in the second half of 2022. Banks’ overall terms and conditions tightened across all main sectors of economic activity, with the most pronounced tightening in the commercial real estate and energy-intensive manufacturing sectors (see Chart 19).
Over the next six months, euro area banks expect a net tightening of credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to firms "

376,000 counterfeit euro banknotes withdrawn from circulation in 2022, second-lowest level ever in proportion to total banknotes in circulation
Around two-thirds of withdrawn counterfeits were €20 and €50 banknotes
Euro banknotes remain trusted and safe means of payment
Authenticity of euro banknotes verified using “feel, look and tilt” method
Some 376,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2022. There is little likelihood of receiving a counterfeit, as the number of counterfeits remains very low in proportion to the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation. In 2022 13 counterfeits were detected per million genuine banknotes in circulation, which is the second-smallest proportion since the introduction of euro banknotes (see the chart below).
Despite this exceptionally small proportion, the number of counterfeits increased by 8.4% compared with 2021 (see Table 1), when the proportion of counterfeits was at its lowest since the euro was introduced. This increase also reflects the recovery of economic activity in 2022 after most coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions had been lifted. €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, together accounting for slightly below two-thirds of the total (see Table 2). 96.6% of the counterfeits were found in euro area countries, while 2.7% were found in non-euro area EU Member States and 0.7% in other parts of the world.
Most counterfeits are easy to detect as they have no security features, or only very poor imitations of such features. The public does not need to be concerned about counterfeiting but should remain vigilant. Notes can be checked using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described on the dedicated security features webpage and on the websites of the euro area national central banks. The Eurosystem also helps professional cash handlers by ensuring that successfully tested machines for handling and processing banknotes can reliably identify counterfeits and withdraw them from circulation.
Using counterfeits for payment is a criminal offence that may lead to prosecution. If you receive a suspicious banknote, compare it directly with one you know to be genuine. If your suspicions are confirmed, please contact the police or – depending on national practice – your national central bank or your own retail or commercial bank. The Eurosystem actively supports law enforcement agencies in their fight against currency counterfeiting.

New experimental and analytical indicators to help analyse climate-related risks in financial sector and monitor green transition
ECB and national central banks to further improve indicators to match quality standards of official ECB statistics
Initial experimental statistics show increasing share of euro area debt securities labelled as green or sustainable
The European Central Bank (ECB) has published a first set of climate-related statistical indicators
[
1
]
today to better assess the impact of climate-related risks on the financial sector and to monitor the development of sustainable and green finance, fulfilling another of the commitments of its climate action plan.
“We need a better understanding of how climate change will affect the financial sector, and vice versa. For this, the development of high-quality data is key,” says Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel. “The indicators are a first step to help narrow the climate data gap, which is crucial to make further progress towards a climate-neutral economy.”
The new indicators are either experimental or analytical. Experimental data comply with many, but not all, of the quality requirements of official ECB statistics.
[
2
]
Analytical data have a lower quality and certain – sometimes significant – limitations.
The indicators are, therefore, a work in progress and should be used with caution. They are intended to start a broader conversation within the statistical and research community and with other key stakeholders on how to better capture data on climate-related risks and the green transition. The ECB, together with the national central banks, will work to improve the methodology and the data used. New data sources, expected to become available in line with EU initiatives on climate-related disclosures and reporting, will help in this respect.
To ensure the indicators are accessible and replicable, they use existing data from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) or other, publicly available, data whenever possible. Specifically, the indicators cover three areas:
Experimental indicators on sustainable finance provide an overview of debt instruments labelled as “green”, “social”, “sustainability” or “sustainability-linked” by the issuer that are issued or held in the euro area. The data show that the volume of sustainable and green bonds has more than doubled over the last two years and grew much faster than the overall euro area bond market. Besides boosting transparency, these indicators also help track progress on the transition to a net-zero economy. That said, the lack of internationally accepted and harmonised standards on what defines a green or sustainable bond makes the data less reliable overall.
Analytical indicators on carbon emissions financed by financial institutions provide information on the carbon intensity of the securities and loan portfolios of financial institutions, and on the financial sector’s exposure to counterparties with carbon-intensive business models. Preliminary results show that in the euro area, most of the emissions financed via equity or bonds are held by investment funds. However, the data suggest that the most carbon-intensive activities are financed via the banking sector, as the companies they finance produce relatively more emissions in their business operations to achieve a given level of revenue.
Analytical indicators on climate-related physical risks analyse the impact of natural hazards, such as floods, wildfires or storms, on the performance of loans, bonds and equities portfolios. While the risk of windstorms broadly affects financial portfolios in the euro area, the risk of this hazard causing severe damage is rather low. In contrast, floods are limited to coastal and river areas but are estimated to have a higher level of damages and losses.
In July 2022 the ECB published a detailed climate action plan on how to incorporate climate change considerations into its monetary policy framework. In October 2022 it started tilting its corporate bond holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance. Today’s publication of new climate-related indicators is another step towards delivering on the ECB’s climate commitments.

Tighter credit terms and conditions offered by banks to investment funds in particular, mainly attributed to deterioration in market liquidity and functioning
Increased overall demand for funding and demand for funding with maturity greater than 30 days in context of deteriorating liquidity conditions for most collateral types
Market participants expressed confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for almost all types of debt securities and for derivatives
On balance, overall credit terms and conditions tightened over the September-November 2022 review period across all counterparty types. Price and non-price terms tightened for all counterparty types, but in particular for investment funds. The overall tightening of credit terms and conditions ? mainly attributed to a deterioration in market liquidity and functioning ? continued the trend reported for the previous six quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the September 2022 survey. Overall credit terms are expected to tighten further over the review period from December 2022 to February 2023. The amount of resources dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures increased during the September-November 2022 review period, continuing a development reported since the March 2022 SESFOD, while the use of financial leverage decreased for investment funds.
In the case of securities financing transactions, the maximum amount of funding offered against collateral in the form of euro-denominated collateral, on balance, decreased for convertible securities in particular but also for high-quality corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and covered bonds. As for the maximum maturity of funding, respondents reported a mixed picture. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral either increased or remained unchanged, while financing rates/spreads increased for financing secured against all collateral types except convertible securities and equities. Survey respondents reported an increased overall demand for funding and demand for funding with a maturity greater than 30 days. The liquidity of all collateral types continued to deteriorate, with the largest percentage of respondents reporting a decrease in the liquidity of high-yield corporate bonds.
Turning to non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, survey respondents reported that initial margin requirements for most OTC derivatives increased during the September-November 2022 review period, but reported only limited changes with respect to the other questions on non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives.
The December 2022 survey included a number of special questions about market-making activities. Survey respondents reported that market-making activities had decreased or remained unchanged for all types of debt securities except domestic government bonds and had increased for derivatives over the past year. They expected market-making activities to broadly increase in 2023. Respondents cited profitability of market-making activities as the main driver of a decrease in market-making activities over the last year. They identified the willingness to take on risk and the availability of balance sheet or capital as the main drivers of expected changes in market-making activities in the year ahead.
Respondents expressed confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for almost all types of debt securities – except high-yield corporate bonds – and for derivatives. They thereby broadly confirmed their assessment of the past two years – with the important exception of asset-backed securities and high-yield corporate bonds, for which they expressed very low confidence. Willingness to take on risk remained the main reason for banks’ confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress.
The December 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The December 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between September 2022 and November 2022. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Compared with October:
consumer inflation expectations 12 months and three years ahead declined;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased, while expectations for nominal spending growth decreased;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months increased, whereas expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to remain broadly unchanged, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. The prolonged rise in perceived inflation over the previous 12 months came to a halt, with the median rate remaining at 9.9%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased from 5.4% to 5.0%, while expectations for inflation three years ahead edged down from 3.0% to 2.9%. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead has been stable since July, although it remains well above the level prevailing before the war in Ukraine. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 0.9% over the next 12 months, up from 0.7% in October. For the first time since mid-2021, expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months decreased – from 4.7% to 4.3%. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months remained unchanged at 6.3%. Expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) again reporting lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months increased from -2.6% in October to -2.0%. Consistent with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead edged down to 12.4%, compared with 12.5% in October. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.8%). Both the expected and the perceived unemployment rates were highest for the lowest income quintile. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access. Consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to remain fairly stable at 3.1%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.8%, 1.5 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Following the tightening reported in October, perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both loosened again.

The euro entered into circulation in Croatia today, bringing the number of European Union (EU) Member States using the single European currency to 20.
“I welcome Croatia to the euro family and to the ECB Governing Council table in Frankfurt” said Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank. “Croatia worked hard to become the twentieth member of the euro area, and it succeeded. I congratulate the Croatian people. It shows the euro is an attractive currency which brings stability to its members.”
With Croatia joining the euro area, Hrvatska narodna banka, the country’s national central bank, becomes a member of the Eurosystem. The euro area’s central banking system comprises the ECB and the national central banks of those countries whose currency is the euro.
Hrvatska narodna banka also becomes a full member of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, although the country has been part of the close cooperation framework since October 2020. As such, the ECB is currently responsible for directly supervising five significant institutions in the country and overseeing 16 less significant institutions there. As part of its supervisory tasks, the ECB is also responsible for licensing banks and assessing the buyers of qualifying holdings in all banks. Hrvatska narodna banka already has a representative on the ECB’s Supervisory Board.
Hrvatska narodna banka has paid the remainder of its contribution to the capital of the ECB and transferred its contribution to the ECB’s foreign reserve assets. Croatian counterparties of the Eurosystem will be able to participate in ECB open market operations announced after 1 January 2023. A list of credit institutions and branches of credit institutions located in Croatia that are subject to reserve requirements will be published shortly on the ECB’s website, as will lists of branches of Croatian credit institutions located in other EU Member States already using the euro. The ECB announced transitional provisions for minimum reserve requirements on 28 October 2022. Assets located in Croatia that fulfil the necessary requirements will be added to the euro area’s list of eligible collateral.
Croatia joining the euro area as its 20th member also means that the new system of rotating voting rights in the ECB’s Governing Council comes into force as of today, with the rights rotating according to a calendar.
Croatia’s membership of the euro area has also led to changes to the Eurosystem capital subscriptions.

Haircut schedules for assets used as collateral in monetary policy operations to be updated with effect from 29 June 2023
Measures aim to ensure adequate level of risk protection, improve consistency of framework and enhance risk equivalence of assets, while ensuring collateral availability
Measures based on ECB’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels for credit operations
The European Central Bank (ECB) today announced the results of the most recent review of its risk control framework for collateralised credit operations. On 24 March 2022 the Governing Council announced its decision to gradually phase out the pandemic collateral easing measures. The ECB also communicated that it would implement a new valuation haircut schedule for credit operations based on its pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels. Following the review, the ECB decided on several measures to improve the overall consistency of the risk control framework which will take effect from 29 June 2023. The measures include the following:
Increase the valuation haircuts for marketable and non-marketable assets to return to the ECB’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance level, based on an updated risk assessment.
Re-assign debt instruments issued by the European Union (EU bonds) from haircut category II to haircut category I, the same as used for debt instruments issued by central governments. This reflects the higher liquidity of EU bonds as a result of issuances under the NextGenerationEU and Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE) instruments.
Phase out the distinction between jumbo and other covered bonds, assigning all covered bonds and multi-cédulas to haircut category II.
Set the haircuts for marketable assets with a floating coupon to be equal to those with a fixed coupon.
Split the longest residual maturity category in the existing haircut schedule into three new categories.
Replace the current flat 5% theoretical valuation markdown with a maturity-graduated markdown schedule, extending its application to all theoretically valued marketable assets except those falling under haircut category I.
The ECB regularly reviews the framework to ensure an adequate level of risk protection and to achieve risk equivalence across asset classes. Following the Governing Council’s July 2022 decision to consider climate change risks when reviewing haircuts, from this review onwards the analysis also aims to ensure the resilience of the haircuts to climate-related financial risks. The present review did not find empirical evidence that necessitates amendments to the haircut schedule based on climate change considerations, as the updated haircut schedule is already sufficiently protective against climate-related financial risks.
The amendments to Guidelines ECB/2014/60, ECB/2015/35 and ECB/2014/31 reflecting the aforementioned measures will be made available on the ECB’s website and will be published in all official EU languages in the Official Journal of the European Union in April 2023.
For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.
Notes
Information on haircut categories can be found on the ECB’s website, which will be updated when the Guidelines enter into effect.

Cash still used for most consumer payments, but share declines further
Share of electronic payments grows further, including day-to-day online purchases
Consumers prefer electronic payment methods, but value having cash as an option
Cash is still the most frequently used means of payment at the point of sale, but its share is declining according to the latest study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area, published today by the European Central Bank (ECB). Cash was used for 59% of point-of-sale transactions in 2022, down from 72% in 2019. It is the means of payment most often used for small-value payments in stores and for person-to-person transactions. A majority (60%) also consider it important to have cash as a payment option. Consumers perceive cash as helpful to remain aware of their expenditures, to protect their privacy and to allow transactions to be settled immediately. Overall, consumers are satisfied with their access to cash, with a large majority of consumers finding it easy to get to an ATM or a bank to withdraw cash in most countries.
At the same time, the trend towards electronic means of payments has accelerated with the pandemic and a majority of consumers now prefer to use electronic payment methods. The share of online purchases as a percentage of all euro area day-to-day transactions has increased significantly to stand at 17% in 2022, up from 6% in 2019. For purchases at a point of sale, the share of card payments has grown by 9 percentage points to 34% in 2022, with contactless payments now making up the majority of card payments. Cards are considered faster and easier to use and are seen as reducing the need to carry large amounts of cash. Cards are the most frequently used payment method for larger payments and account now for a higher share of payments than cash in value terms.
“The ECB is committed to ensuring that consumers remain free to choose how to pay, both now and in the future,” said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. “We are seeing confirmation of strong demand for both cash and digital payments. Our commitment to cash and our ongoing work on a digital euro aims to ensure that paying with public money is always an option.”
The next study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area will be published in 2024.

,"Foreword
The ongoing digitalisation of the economy affects almost all aspects of our daily lives, including the ways in which we pay. The Eurosystem has a key interest in understanding how the payment landscape is evolving and how citizens in the euro area pay for goods and services, as well as how they pay to each other. Ensuring access to means of payment, cash and cashless, is at the heart of both the Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy and its Cash 2030 strategy.
To get a better understanding of how consumers are changing their payment habits, and to what extent, in 2019 the ECB launched a survey to investigate the payment attitudes and behaviours of euro area citizens. To capture changing payment behaviour in a timely manner, the Eurosystem decided to repeat the survey every two years.
The second of these surveys was launched in 2021 and completed in 2022. This report presents the results and describes the key trends identified in euro area consumer payments. While the move towards cashless payments continues, as the report shows, cash still plays an important role. It remains the predominant payment method at the point of sale and for person-to-person payments. Nonetheless, cashless payments are on the rise, supported by a shift from purchases at the point of sale to online purchases. The rate of increase varies across countries and demographic groups. Taking into account ongoing shifts in the payment landscape, the report sheds light on the perceived availability and costs of instant payments for consumers, and on the ownership and use of crypto assets for payment and investment purposes.
Monitoring these trends closely going forward is important for us, in view of our responsibility for issuing public money (currently in the form of cash, and possibly in the future in the form of a digital euro alongside cash) and promoting the smooth functioning of payment systems. This will help us ensure that means of payment remain accessible to all euro area citizens, regardless of their age, income or place of residence, guaranteeing consumers’ freedom to choose how they pay, even in a time of digital transformation.

Executive summary
Following on from the first Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE) in 2019, the European Central Bank (ECB) has now conducted a second one. This report presents the key findings from SPACE 2022 and compares them with the results of the 2019 study and, where relevant, with an earlier ECB study conducted in 2016, the Study on the use of cash by households in the euro area (SUCH). When interpreting the 2022 results it is important to note that while no major lockdowns were in place in most euro area countries during the fieldwork periods, the payment behaviour of consumers was still affected by various measures related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – both before and between the survey rounds. These led to restricted entry and even closure of some points of sale, such as restaurants and venues for culture and entertainment, in some Member States.
The SPACE 2022 results show that:
Cash was the most frequently used payment method at the point of sale (POS) in the euro area and was used in 59% of transactions, down from 79% in 2016 and 72% in 2019.
Card payments were used in 34% of POS transactions, up from 19% in 2016 and 25% in 2019.
Other payment methods were used for 7% of POS transactions.
The share of payments using mobile apps increased from less than 1% in 2019 to 3% in 2022.
In terms of value of payments, cards (46%) accounted for a higher share of transactions than cash payments (42%). This contrasts with 2016 and 2019, when the share of cash transactions was higher than the share of card transactions (54% compared to 39% in 2016 and 47% compared to 43% in 2019).
Contactless card payments at the POS increased considerably in three years, from 41% of all card payments in 2019 to 62% in 2022.
Cash was most frequently used for small value payments at the POS, in line with previous comparable surveys. For payments over €50, cards were the most frequently used method.
Cash was the dominant means of payment in person-to-person (P2P) transactions in the euro area. However, its share in the total number of payments declined from 86% in 2019 to 73% in 2022, and from 65% to 59% in terms of value.
Cashless means of payments, particularly mobile phone apps, increased in P2P payments. Between 2019 and 2022, the share of mobile payments more than tripled in terms of number from 3% to 10%, and rose from 4% to 11% in terms of value.
The share of online payments in consumers’ non-recurring payments increased from 6% in 2019 to 17% in 2022.
Online payments were used especially for buying food and daily supplies from supermarkets and restaurants.
The large majority of recurring payments were made using either direct debit or credit transfers.
In the SPACE 2022 questionnaire, 55% of euro area consumers expressed a preference for cards and other cashless payments when paying in a shop, while 22% preferred cash and 23% had no clear preference.
Nevertheless, the majority of euro area consumers considered having cash as a payment option to be important or very important.
The perceived key advantages of cards were that consumers don’t have to carry cash with them, coupled with the convenience of contactless payments.
The perceived key advantages of cash were its anonymity and protection of privacy and the perception that it makes one more aware of one’s own expenses.
Compared to before the outbreak of the pandemic, the majority of consumers (54%) said there had been no change in how often they use cash at physical points of sale; 31% of consumers indicated that they were using cash less often and 14% more often.
For those who reported using cash less often, the most frequently mentioned reason was that paying electronically has become more convenient.
Cash withdrawals were mostly made from automated teller machines (ATMs), which account for 74% of all cash withdrawals. The use of own cash reserves accounted for 11% and withdrawals over the bank counter for 6%.
Most euro area consumers were satisfied with their access to cash. The vast majority of consumers (90%) found it fairly easy or very easy to get to an ATM or a bank (up from 89% in 2019). The remaining 10% said it was fairly or very difficult.
37% of consumers kept cash reserves at home, outside the wallet or a bank account, up from 34% in 2019.
Cash was accepted in 95% of physical payment locations throughout the euro area, down from 98% in 2019.
In the euro area it was possible to pay with non-cash instruments in 81% of transactions in 2022.
Introduction
The way consumers in the euro area pay and the payment instruments they prefer are constantly evolving. Monitoring payment methods on a continuous basis makes it possible to capture changes in consumer demand and market trends.
The Study on the use of cash by households in the euro area (SUCH)
[
1
]
was the first payment behaviour survey conducted by the ECB, back in 2016. Results from SUCH are only comparable to the SPACE studies to a limited extent because the survey modes were different and the output variables only partially overlap. The first study on payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE)
[
2
]
was conducted in 2019 and will be followed up by comparable surveys on a biannual basis.
The results from the SPACE survey make it possible to estimate the share of different payment instruments used by consumers at the point of sale (POS),
[

]
for person-to-person payments (P2P),
[
4
]
online and for recurring payments
[
5
]
in various ways, including by demographics and payment patterns. In addition, the surveys give an insight into consumers’ access to and acceptance of cash and other means of payment.
Compared to the 2019 survey, SPACE 2022 additionally looked at: (i) changes in payment behaviour since the onset of the pandemic; (ii) recent trends in digital payments, such as the availability and perceived cost of instant payments; (iii) crypto assets, including information on respondents’ ownership and usage patterns. The results should also serve to better illustrate consumers’ preferences for cash holdings.
1 Summary of research methodology
Data for SPACE 2022
[
6
]
were collected through a survey of a random sample of the population in all euro area countries. The most important methodological choices – such as the survey mode, sampling strategy and weighting methodology – were identical to SPACE 2019, making the results of most indicators comparable. A detailed description of the methodologies used is available in a separate document
[
7
]
This section briefly summarises the methodology.
The ECB coordinated the data collection in 17 euro area countries, i.e. all except Germany and the Netherlands. The Deutsche Bundesbank (2022) and De Nederlandsche Bank and the Dutch Payments Association (2022) collected their own data with questionnaires harmonised to a large extent with the one used in the other countries.
The data for all countries except Germany and the Netherlands were collected using an identical questionnaire translated into national languages. The market research company Kantar Public was responsible for data collection. 50% of the interviews were collected in computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and 50% in computer-assisted web interviews (CAWI). The CATI sample was drawn with probabilistic methods, while the CAWI sample was drawn from non-probabilistic Kantar Public online panels. For both samples, quotas for country, age, gender and day of the week were set. The total sample size achieved in the 17 euro area countries was 39,765 respondents.
The interview process consisted of three parts: a recruitment interview, the recording period and the main (follow up) interview. The payment diary was split into modules covering (i) POS payments, (ii) P2P payments, (iii) online payments and (iv) recurring payments. Survey respondents were asked to report their POS, P2P and online transactions in a one-day diary, and their recurring payments from the past 30 days.

When interpreting the survey results it is important to recognise the benefits and caveats of recording payment behaviour in one-day diaries. Transactions are recorded more comprehensively in diaries covering one day than those with a period of several days (Jonker and Kosse, 2013). However, the degree of uncertainty involved in any survey data is more pronounced in one-day diaries, especially for drawing conclusions on countries and other subgroups of the population with small sample sizes. Data from a longer diary period include more transactions per sample unit and consequently increase the precision of the estimated indicators (Schmidt, 2014). In particular, indicators on the value of POS and online payments need to be interpreted with care.
In addition to the diary, respondents were asked questions about their behaviour and attitudes to cash and cashless payment instruments in the main interview. Further questions aimed to understand which financial products were available to them, the extent of their access to the internet and how the pandemic had impacted their payment behaviour.
SPACE 2022 interviews were conducted in two survey rounds. During the first, between 2 October and 7 December 2021, 40% of interviews were carried out; the remaining ones were held in the second round, between 17 March and 9 June 2022. The survey rounds were spread across different months of the year to cover various periods and capture seasonal patterns in peoples’ payment behaviour (see Table 1).
[

]
In Germany the data were collected in one survey round between 8 September and 5 December 2021. In contrast to the ECB data collection, the German participants were asked to complete a three-day diary. In the Netherlands the diary data and main questionnaire were collected for different samples; the diary data were collected in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the data for the main questionnaire in the first quarter of 2022.
After the fieldwork period the data were cleaned, edited, and imputed.
[
10
]
The sample was weighted to minimise the observable bias of survey estimates and enable solid inferences to be made based on the demographic characteristics.
The report includes figures from SUCH 2016 and SPACE 2019 when comparison with SPACE 2022 results is deemed practical and the data are comparable. In addition, after the first iteration of SPACE data collection in 2019, the ECB collected information on the impact of the early phases of the pandemic in a separate survey (the survey on the impact of the pandemic on cash trends or IMPACT survey). Some results of that survey were included in SPACE 2019 and are referred to in this report.
For time series comparisons the payment diary data from 2016 and 2019 were adjusted for inflation. For each country, one price adjustment factor per year was applied.
[

]
Most of the 2019 data are comparable with the 2022 data. However, due to a change in the definition of online payments between 2019 and 2022,
[
12
]
online purchases paid with cash or bank cheques in the 2019 data have been re-classified as POS payments.

2 Trends in payment habits
Two major trends in the way consumers pay for their daily non-recurring payments between 2019 and 2022 have been identified. First, online payments
[
14
]
have become more frequent. Second, the share of cash payments at the POS has declined. The less frequent use of cash was already identified in 2019 and the pandemic probably accelerated both trends.
Even though no major lockdowns were in place in most euro area countries during the fieldwork periods,
[
15
]
the payment behaviour of consumers was still affected by various measures related to the pandemic. However, it is still uncertain whether this tendency will continue at the pace observed over the past three years, or return to its pre-pandemic path once certain causes inherent in the pandemic cease to apply.
2.1 Change in the breakdown of non-recurring payments
Non-recurring day-to-day payments consist of payments made to purchase goods and services at the physical point of sale, P2P payments not connected to the purchase of goods and services and online payments. Online payments were defined as goods and services ordered and paid for online. However, goods ordered online but paid while picking up the goods or to the courier delivering the goods were defined as POS payments.
The share of online payments in consumers’ non-recurring purchases increased considerably between 2019 and 2022 in the euro area. Even though there were no major lockdowns in most euro area countries during the fieldwork periods of the latest SPACE survey, those experienced between the data collection periods may have changed the behaviour of some consumers and made them better acquainted with purchasing goods and services online. As shown in Chart 1, of all day-to-day payments, 17% were made online in 2022, compared with only 6% in 2019. In terms of value, the share of online payments in 2022 was 28% (up from 14%), indicating that online payments were more frequently used for larger payment amounts.
The share of the number of P2P transactions in non-recurring payments declined slightly, down from 5% to 4%. The change in the value of P2P payments declined a little more, from 7% to 5%.

2.2 Use of cash is declining, but remains most important at the POS
The share of cash payments at the point of sale
[

]
in terms of volume has declined in recent years. This decline accelerated during the pandemic. In 2022, 59% of transactions were carried out using cash. Three years earlier the share of cash transactions was 72%; in 2016 the figure was 79%. However, cash remained the most frequently used method for payments at the POS in the euro area.
When measuring POS transactions in terms of value, the share of card transactions in 2022 (46%) was higher than the share of cash transactions (42%) for the first time. In 2019 the share of cash transactions by value was 47% and the equivalent share of card transactions 43% (Chart 2).
Consumers were making payments using mobile phone apps more often than before. However, their share in total POS payments was still relatively low compared to cash and card payments. Mobile phone payments accounted for 3% of the number of transactions in 2022 (up from 1% in 2019) and 4% of the value (up from 1%).

Box 1
The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on payment behaviour
A trend of decreasing cash payments was observed even before the pandemic broke out. The expectation was that this would continue or even accelerate as a result. Lockdowns of varying degrees, recommendations by public authorities and shops to avoid using cash and better availability of card and mobile payments may all have contributed to the decline in cash use. To evaluate the impact of the pandemic, respondents were asked to assess how and why they had changed their payment habits compared to two or three years earlier, before it broke out.
Chart A shows that more than half of consumers (54%) did not change their payment behaviour with regard to using cash at physical locations due to the pandemic. 31% said that they used cash less often than before the pandemic and 14% said they used it more often. These personal assessments are in line with the changes observed in the share of cash transactions at the POS.

(percentages)
Sources: ECB, calculations based on De Nederlandsche Bank and the Dutch Payments Association (2022) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2022).
Note: The survey question was: “Compared with the situation two years ago [three in the second survey round] before the coronavirus pandemic, are you using cash instead of non-cash payment methods more or less often for your payments in physical locations (shops, restaurants, etc.)?”
For those who reduced their use of cash during the pandemic, the most frequently reported reason (mentioned by more than half) was that paying electronically has been made more convenient. Advice not to pay with cash (42%) and government recommendations (29%) ranked second and third (see Chart B). About one in four respondents indicated that fear of virus infection was the reason for their less frequent cash use, a much lower share than observed in the IMPACT survey at the beginning of the pandemic (European Central Bank, 2020). The fading fear of virus infections from cash (a fear that has been shown to be mostly unfounded in recent microbiological studies, see Tamele et al, 2021) shows that some behavioural patterns caused by the pandemic have diminished. Consequently, the changes in payment habits experienced over the past few years may prove temporary if the remaining causes cease to apply once the pandemic is over or the virus becomes endemic.

Note: The survey question was: “Which of the following reasons best explain why you now make cash payments less often than before the coronavirus pandemic?”
The impact of the pandemic on online shopping was more pronounced than on cash use at the POS, albeit with the opposite sign. As shown in Chart C, 37% of consumers were buying goods online more often than before the pandemic and 41% said there had been no change. Only 8% bought goods online less often than before the pandemic and 11% said they never buy goods online. The reported increase in online shopping was also apparent in the results on the breakdown of non-recurring payments, where there was a significant increase (see Section 2.2.1).

Notes: The survey question was: “Compared with the situation two years ago [three in the second survey round] before the coronavirus pandemic started, are you buying goods online more or less often?”. The chart does not include the 3% of the population who responded “Don’t know”.
3 Payment behaviour by payment situation
Of all non-recurring payment transactions in 2022, 80% were POS, 17% online and 4% P2P. The share of POS in terms of value was approximately two-thirds. Pronounced differences in the breakdown of payment instrument use can be observed from these differing payment situations.
3.1 Share of online payments in non-recurring payments
As seen in Box 1, self-assessment information provided by consumers suggests they increased their online shopping during the pandemic. This change was also reflected in the data on actual payment behaviour in every euro area country (Chart 3). Online payments have become more frequent in comparison to POS and P2P across the euro area. In 2022, at least 10% of all non-recurring transactions were online payments in every euro area country. This is a notable change, given that online payments accounted for less than 5% of non-recurring payments in Malta, Cyprus and Germany in 2019. In several countries the share of online payments in 2022 was over 20%, the highest values being reported in Belgium (24%), Austria and Ireland (both 21%) and France (20%).
Online payments were more frequently made for larger-value purchases. The share of online payments was higher in terms of value than number. The highest shares of online payments by value were reported in Slovenia (40%), Finland (37%), Belgium (36%) and Austria (35%).

Note: EA19 refers to the euro area (19 countries).
Chart 4 shows that the share of online transactions in non-recurring payments decreases by age, except for those aged 18-24, who made slightly fewer online purchases than those aged 25-39. The reason for this may be that consumers under the age of 24 have less frequent access to payment accounts than other age groups (see Chapter 8.2). Comparing young adults (25-39) to those aged 65 and older, the share of online payments falls from 22% to only 11%. However, people in the latter age group made more online purchases than three years ago.
The share of online shopping was also significantly higher for consumers with higher education. Improvements in the market for online shopping have enabled consumers with sufficient technological literacy to conduct more price arbitrage for their non-recurring payments. The relationship between household income and online purchases is not straightforward. When measured in terms of number of payments, the share of online purchases in non-recurring payments was highest for the two lowest income groups, and relatively similar for households in income groups with monthly income above €1,000.

3.2 POS transactions
3.2.1 Cross-country differences in payment behaviour at the POS
There are large cross-country differences in the payment habits of consumers when purchasing goods or services at the POS (Chart 5). In several countries, a clear majority of POS payments in 2022 were made in cash. The highest shares in terms of number of payments were observed in Malta (77%), Slovenia (73%), Austria (70%) and Italy (69%), and in terms of value of payments in Malta (65%), Lithuania (61%) and Slovenia (59%). Card payments were the most frequently used method at the POS in 2022 in four euro area countries: Finland (70%), the Netherlands (67%), Luxembourg (52%) and Belgium (48%). In Estonia, the share of card payments was almost identical to the share of cash payments (both 46%).
Although payments with mobile apps have increased in recent years, their share in POS payments was still relatively low. The share of mobile payments (by number of transactions) was highest in the Netherlands (10%), and exceeded 5% in Finland, Ireland, Latvia and Luxembourg.

Notes: EA19 refers to the euro area (19 countries). The category “Other” includes bank cheques, credit transfers, loyalty points, vouchers and gift cards and other payment instruments. The definition of POS payments differs from the one used in Deutsche Bundesbank (2022), where only payments in supermarkets, local shops, drugstores and petrol stations are included.
Compared with 2019, the use of cash has declined. This was observed across most euro area countries, although in both Slovenia and Estonia the share of cash payments is virtually unchanged. Cash use declined most in southern European countries: Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal (Figure 1). Measured by value, the share of cash payments has even increased in some euro area countries.
The indicators on payments by value reflect uncertainties, as well as the data for countries that have a small sample size. In particular, variations between the different years and among countries in such cases should be interpreted with caution.

3.2.2 Differences in payment behaviour at the POS by subgroup
Looking at the share of cash transactions at the POS by age group, it can be seen that older age groups (i.e. those over 55) tended to use cash relatively more often than younger generations (Chart 6). The share of cash payments in the oldest age group was 5 percentage points higher than the average for all consumers; among those aged 25-39 (who make the least cash payments) it was 4 percentage points lower than the euro area average.
Overall for the euro area, all age groups made more than half of their POS payments in cash. The differences among age groups are similar in terms of value of transactions. All age groups made more payments with cards than with cash in terms of value.
The share of cash payments also declines as respondents’ level of education and income rises.
[
18
]
Those with a low level of education reported a share of cash transactions 8 percentage points higher than individuals with a high level of education.
[

]
The highest earning group paid just above half of its POS transactions with cash, while the lowest income group paid two-thirds. In terms of value, the two highest income groups paid more than 50% of their POS payments with cards.

Box 2
Use of contactless technology for card payments
Contactless technology refers to the ability to pay with cards or electronic devices by holding the card or device a few centimetres away from a retailer’s payment terminal. This technology has made card payments faster and easier in certain settings. These two benefits ranked second and third among the perceived advantages of card payments in 2022 (see Section 6.3). When paying by card using the contactless function it is necessary to switch to chip and personal identification number (PIN) if certain thresholds are exceeded. The most basic transaction value limit was increased to the legally permissible level of €50 per transaction in all euro area countries in 2019.
[
20
]
The PIN can also be required after a certain number of transactions per day or when a total amount has been reached, making contactless payments more robust against fraud.
The pandemic accelerated use of contactless payments. For hygiene reasons, the ability to settle a transaction without the need to exchange cash or physically touch the payment terminal made contactless payments more attractive.
Contactless card payments at the POS went from representing 41% of all card payments in 2019 to 62% in 2022, as shown in Chart A. The change in habits varies substantially between different euro area countries. Lithuania was the only country where contactless payments as a share of the total number of transactions with cards decreased, from 54% to 53%; however, this needs to be interpreted with caution due to possible margin errors. Cyprus was the country where contactless payments had the highest share of total card payments in 2022 (88%), followed by Slovakia (84%) and Greece (84%). Belgium was the country with the lowest share of contactless card payments in 2022 (39%), as it had been in 2019. Germany in particular saw considerable growth in contactless payments as a share of total card payments, although it should be noted that the first data point for Germany is from 2017 rather than 2019.
[
21
]
When it comes to the value of transactions made with contactless payments compared to the total value of transactions made with cards, the share of contactless payments increased from 27% to 50%. Greece and Finland were the only countries that saw the share in the value of contactless transactions decline, falling from 75% to 69% and 36% to 35%, respectively. The three countries with the highest percentage of contactless card payments by value in 2022 were Cyprus (81%), Slovakia (75%) and Slovenia (74%); Belgium had the lowest figure (28%).

3.3 P2P payments
P2P payments are private payments between individuals not connected to the purchase of goods and services. Examples may include giving pocket money to children or donating money to charity. The breakdown of P2P payments by instrument is quite different from that of POS payments. As can be expected, the role of cards in P2P payments is small, given that private individuals rarely have ability to accept card payments. On the other hand, cash and mobile payments are used for P2P payments more frequently than for POS payments (Chart 7).
Cash was the dominant means of payment in P2P transactions, although its share in the total number of payments in the euro area declined from 86% in 2019 to 73% in 2022, as shown in Chart 7. In terms of value, the share of cash declined from 65% to 59%. P2P payments with mobile phone apps are becoming more frequent. In 2022,10% of P2P payments were made using mobile phones, compared to 3% in 2019. The share of payment methods other than cash, cards or mobile payments also increased between 2019 and 2022, mainly due to the increase in private payments using credit transfers.

Looking at P2P payments by country in Chart 8, the share of cash in terms of the number of payments was over 80% in Germany, Cyprus, Slovenia, Greece, Italy and Austria, while cash was used for less than half of P2P transactions in Estonia, Finland and the Netherlands. The share of mobile phone apps in P2P payments was highest in the Netherlands (43%). In Finland, Estonia, Luxembourg and Malta the share of mobile payments in P2P transactions was about 25%. In value terms, the share of mobile payments was even higher, reaching 52% in the Netherlands and 34% in Luxembourg. The role of credit transfers, included in Chart 8 under Other, was also bigger in P2P payments than in payments at the POS.

3.4 Online payments
Online payments, as defined in this report, include any payments made online, excluding regular bill payments such as electricity bills or rent. These are analysed separately as recurring payments in Section 5. The SPACE 2022 diary clearly distinguished between online payments and online purchases, meaning that any orders made online but paid at the point of sale (e.g. when picking up food from a restaurant or paying a courier at the door) were reported as POS payments.
[
22
]
Chart 3 shows that the share of the number of online payments in non-recurring payments increased significantly between 2019 and 2022. In 2022 consumers made over three times more online payments than in 2019. The breakdown of online payments, however, remained relatively stable.
More than half of online payments were made with cards (Chart 9). The share of card payments declined slightly between 2019 and 2022, from 54% down to 51%. The use of PayPal and similar online or mobile payment solutions has decreased slightly. The variety of online payment methods has grown in recent years; 9% of all online payments were made using a method the respondent could not identify from the answer options in the questionnaire.
[
23
]
In terms of payment value, the share of credit transfers was larger. Consequently, credit transfers were used more often for large-value payments compared to other payment instruments.

The breakdown of online payments varies a great deal by country (Chart 10). The use of e-payment solutions such as iDeal, PayPal and Klarna is by far the most frequent way to pay for online purchases in the Netherlands. E-payment solutions account for a large share of all online payment methods in Germany, too.
[

However, card payments were still the most frequently used instrument for online payments in most euro area countries.

In the 2019 data iDeal was classified under credit transfers.
4 Payment behaviour by value range and purpose
4.1 POS and online payments by value range
Purchase price influences how and where consumers pay for goods and services. Smaller-value purchases are typically paid for at the POS, with higher-value payments more often made online. In 2022, the share of POS payments under €20 was almost 60%, while only 4% of POS payments had a price higher than €100. Conversely, online purchases for less than €10 were infrequent and more than one online payment in four had a price over €50 (see Chart 11, left-hand panel).

Note: For POS payments, “Other” includes bank cheques, credit transfers, loyalty points, vouchers and gift cards and other payment instruments. For online payments, “E-payment solutions” includes PayPal and other online or mobile payment method (e.g. Klarna, Sofort, iDeal, Afterpay). “Other” includes, loyalty points, vouchers and gift cards, crypto assets and other payment instruments.
The share of various payment instruments used for high and low-value payments is very different. Looking at POS transactions, the use of cash was especially common for purchases of lower value, in line with the findings of previous surveys. Four out of five POS purchases for less than €5 were paid with cash (Chart 11). Although mostly in line with previous surveys, the share of card transactions for low-value payments has increased since 2019. For example, for payments below €5, the share of payments using a card went from 7% in 2019 to 15% in 2022. Similarly, for payments between €5 and €10, the share of card payments went from 15% in 2019 to 24% in 2022.
The share of cash transactions declines significantly with transaction value. For purchases over €50, cards were the most frequently used payment method at the POS. However, almost one-third of POS payments over €100 were still made with cash. The share of payments with a mobile app was relatively stable across value ranges, although they were used slightly more frequently for higher-value payments.
There is no clear pattern in the use of online payment methods for purchases of different value. Credit transfers were used more frequently for higher-value payments and cards slightly less frequently. PayPal and other e-payment solutions were used for about one online payment in four, regardless of their value.
4.2 POS and online payments by location and purpose
4.2.1 Payments at the POS by location
Payments at the point of sale include very different kinds of purchases. Consumers can for example buy day-to-day goods at a supermarket, consumer durables or home services, make purchases in hotels, restaurants, venues for culture and sports or petrol stations, or buy tickets or other goods from vending machines. SPACE 2022 aimed to capture different payment situations as accurately as possible in order to understand how consumers’ payment behaviour differs across a variety of locations and purposes (see Chart 12).
Most transactions, both in terms of number and value, were made in supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day goods. Their share of the total number of purchases was 54% in 2022. The share of restaurants, cafes and hotels was 18%.
The breakdown of payments by location remained essentially stable from SPACE 2019. In 2022 consumers were making slightly more transactions in supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day goods. Payments at restaurants, cafes and hotels declined slightly; this may reflect patterns learnt during the pandemic. While food stores were kept open during most lockdown periods, restaurants and hotels stayed closed for extended periods in some euro area countries. The share of payments at venues for sports, culture and entertainment also declined, but this figure was already relatively low in 2019. Although there were no significant lockdowns during the fieldwork periods in the autumn of 2021 and spring of 2022, consumption behaviour learnt during the pandemic may still have had a longer-term behavioural impact on consumers. Looking at the value of POS transactions, only limited changes in payment behaviour by location were witnessed compared with 2019.

Notes: “Day-to-day items” includes purchases from supermarkets, shops for day-to-day items and street markets or vendors. “Restaurants and hotels” includes restaurants, bars and cafes, hotels and similar. “Other” includes services outside, inside or around the home, at public authorities and post offices, and at other physical locations.
Cash was used most frequently for payments at vending machines (74%), in restaurants and hotels (68%) and in supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day goods (61%). In shops selling durable goods the share of card transactions was higher than the share of cash transactions (51% compared to 39%). Mobile app payments were used with similar frequency across all locations; the share varied between 3% and 5%. The highest share of mobile payments was reported in venues for culture and sports (see Chart 13).
Overall, consumers were using cash less frequently at the POS in 2022 than they did 2019. There are considerable differences in how this change in behaviour was observed in various types of locations. The share of cash transactions declined by more than 10 percentage points in restaurants and hotels, venues for culture and sports, supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day items, as well as in other places, which includes home services, public offices and other non-categorised venues. On the other hand, cash was used in 2022 at approximately the same frequency for payments at petrol stations and vending machines as in 2019. In fact, the share of cash payments by value at these locations even increased.

4.2.2 Online payments by purpose
SPACE collects data on online payments by purpose, distinguishing between the most frequent purposes of non-recurring payments, such as food and daily supplies, clothes, household durables and media and entertainment (e.g. games and music). Between 2019 and 2022 consumers increased their online shopping considerably, as mentioned earlier. The breakdown of online payments by purpose also changed considerably.
Online shopping for food and daily supplies, including both restaurant and grocery store deliveries, has become much more frequent. Online delivery was the only available means of purchasing restaurant food almost everywhere at the height of lockdown, with evidence suggesting consumers may have retained the habit even after the pandemic. The share of payments for food in all online payments has grown from 10% to 24%, as seen in Chart 14. Buying medicine and cosmetics online has also become more frequent. The share of online payments for all other purposes decreased compared to payments for food and medicine. Given the large increase in total online shopping, this does not necessarily indicate that the total value of online shopping for these purposes (e.g. clothes and consumer durables) has decreased.

5 Recurring payments
In addition to day-to-day payments, consumers make various kinds of recurring payments on a weekly, monthly, annual or other basis. SPACE 2022 collected information on recurring payments in eight categories: rent or mortgage, utility bills, insurance, telephone or internet bills, taxes and public charges, subscriptions (e.g. magazines, sports club, streaming TV), season tickets for transport and loans. The SPACE data refer to payments made by individuals during the 30-day reporting period.
[
25
]
Recurring payments were most frequently used for telephone and internet bills (78%), followed by utility bills (70%) and insurance (51%), as indicated in Chart 15. About 20% of consumers paid back consumer loans and 14% purchased season tickets for public transport. The average value of payments differs substantially between the various payment types, from €41 for subscriptions to almost €600 for rent or mortgage.

(percentages)
Sources: ECB, calculations based on De Nederlandsche Bank and the Dutch Payments Association (2022) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2022).
Recurring payments are of a very different nature to daily transactions, and consequently the patterns of using various payment instruments are also different. For most types of recurring payment direct debit was the most frequently used instrument, used by approximately half of consumers. Another 30-40% paid their recurring bills by credit transfer. Cards, cash or other instruments were used by less than 10% of consumers for most recurring payments.
Two categories, subscriptions to magazines, streaming TV, etc. and tickets for public transport follow different patterns (Chart 16). This may be explained by the smaller amounts of such payments, as well as the distinct profile of consumers opting to make such payments and the fact that transport tickets are normally bought at physical locations (e.g. dedicated machines). While direct debit was the most frequently used method for subscriptions, card payments were used most often for transport tickets. For the latter, 24% of recurring payments were made in cash, indicating that they are often made at the POS rather than remotely.

6 Preferences for and advantages of cash and cashless payments
6.1 The importance of having the option to pay with cash
While use of and preferences for cash payments are on a declining trend, the importance of cash remains at a high level.
[
26
]
Overall, 60% of the euro area population considered having the option to pay with cash to be very or fairly important, as it can be seen in Chart 17. More than half of the population considered the option to pay with cash fairly or very important in this survey, even in countries like Belgium, Luxembourg and Finland, where consumers were using other payment options for the majority of POS purchases.

Notes: EA19 refers to the euro area (19 countries). The survey question was: “How important is it for you to have the option of using cash?”
Looking across demographic groups, Chart 18 shows that the ability to always pay in cash seemed to be more important for respondents older than 55 and those with upper/post-secondary education, with no notable differences by gender.

6.2 Preferences at the POS
How people pay can be influenced by various factors; revealed preferences may be one of these. Payment preferences play a major role in guiding consumers’ use of different payment methods and are influenced by several factors: age, income, habits, education, job, etc. This section shows the declining preference for cash at the POS as well as the trends for online payments.
The extent to which paying by different means (cash, cards, credit transfer, direct debit, e-money or other means) is preferred differed greatly from country to country (Chart 19). Overall, the general preference for cash decreased by 5 percentage points from SPACE 2019 (Chart 20). Since 2016, strict cash preference has witnessed a steady decline – from 32% of the respondents preferring it in 2016, down to 27% in 2019 and 22% in 2022.

Notes: EA19 refers to the euro area (19 countries). The survey question was: “If you were offered various payment methods in a shop, what would be your preference?”
Nonetheless, in a few countries the preference for cash increased from 2019: Belgium (up 9 percentage points), Estonia (up 7 percentage points), France (up 5 percentage points), Austria (up 3 percentage points) and Slovenia (up 2 percentage points).

Notes: EA19 refers to the euro area (19 countries). The survey question was: “If you were offered various payment methods in a shop, what would be your preference?”. Bars show those who answered “Cash”.
Despite a declining stated preference for cash, it remained the most used payment instrument for POS transactions, being used in 59% of them (see Chart 2). Once again, this is testament to the discrepancy between consumers’ stated preferences and their actual behaviour, as identified in previous studies such as SPACE 2019. The reasons might be various. The question is asked in general, and no distinction can be made between high-volume payments and low-volume ones. Respondents might have a preference for cash when making low-value payments, for instance. Another reason could be acceptance of different means of payment on the part of the merchant. The literature suggests that higher cash usage is associated with lower levels of perceived card acceptance at the POS (Bagnall et al., 2016; Wakamori and Welte, 2017).
Looking at euro area results by demographics (see Chart 21), no big difference emerged between male and female behaviour. Around 21% of male respondents and 22% of female respondents preferred cash, compared to 55% of male and 54% of female respondents who preferred cashless payment.
[
28
]
A more pronounced difference can be seen in the attitude of people in the age groups 18-24 and 65+. In fact, 24% of each of these two categories stated they prefer cash, against 20% of the age groups 25-39 and 40-54. 23% of respondents aged 55-64 expressed a cash preference. In terms of education level, 24% of respondents with a primary or lower-secondary education declared they prefer cash, against 17% of people holding a university-level education or a PhD.

6.3 Perceived advantages of payment instruments, cash and cards
According to Hernandez et al (2017), how consumers perceive payment instruments, and their characteristics influences payment behaviour. SPACE 2022 collected information on the perceived main advantages of cash and cards. The main reasons why cash is preferred were: (i) cash is considered to make one more aware of one’s own expenses; (ii) cash is perceived as anonymous (and therefore protects privacy); (iii) cash transactions are perceived to be immediately settled. The first two reasons were chosen by 40% of the population (see Chart 22).

Top three advantages of cash

Notes: Percentages do not add up to 100%, as respondents could choose up to three answers each. The survey question was: “For you personally, what are the three most important advantages of cash as compared with card payments? Cash payments…”
Two of the three most important perceived advantages of cash have changed dramatically over the past five years.
[
29
]
In 2016, 42% of the population stated that by using cash they had a clear overview of their own spending. However, when it came to the second and third advantages, 38% answered that cash was always accepted (against the 27% in 2022 who said it was accepted in more situations), while 32% stated that cash payments were fast (against 19% in 2022). Not only has the preference for the wide acceptance of cash declined – anonymity has acquired a more prominent role in respondents’ opinions, rising from 13% in 2016 to over 40% in 2022. This could be partly for methodological reasons, as anonymity and privacy protection were bundled together in 2022, while the 2019 survey only asked respondents about their preference for anonymity. However, since not all respondents may appreciate the difference between anonymity and privacy protection, it is possible that awareness of privacy protection has increased. The fact that cash payments are immediately settled has acquired importance; in 2016 only 13% selected that option as an advantage. The ease and safety of cash payments, on the other hand, have stayed relatively constant (ease: 21% in 2016, 19% in 2022; safety: 16% in 2016, 17% in 2022).
When it comes to the advantages of card payments, a relatively large majority (62%) saw the key advantage as being that they don’t have to carry a lot of cash with them (see Chart 23). In 2016 only 33% cited a similar, although not identical, reason (avoiding the need to check whether you are carrying enough cash). Other reasons selected for preferring cards to cash have hardly changed. The share of the population deeming card payments easier has decreased slightly (down from 40% to 37%), while the share of those thinking card transactions are faster has grown 5 percentage points (up from 35% to 40% of respondents). Consumers feeling that card transactions are safer have increased 3 percentage points (23% to 26%). Almost no change is visible in consumers who see widespread acceptance as a top advantage (20% in 2016; 19% in 2022).

7 Cash in wallet and cash reserves
This section presents an analysis of both cash reserves and cash in wallet maintained by euro area citizens.
The likelihood of using cash for transactions increases when the level of cash holdings is higher (Bagnall et al., 2016; Arango et al., 2015). Estimating the amount of cash in wallet might shed light on the reasons behind consumers’ decision to pay in cash. Respondents in the survey were asked to report the exact amount of cash in their wallet at the beginning of the day. People in the euro area possessed an average of €83 in their wallet, as shown in Chart 24. The average amount of cash held varied across countries. In Austria, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Lithuania the average amount was more than €110 – not too divergent from the 2019 findings.

Note: The chart shows the average excluding respondents declaring they had more than EUR 5,000 in their pockets at the beginning of the day.
As already seen in SPACE 2019, cash is also used as a store of value in the euro area (European Central Bank, 2020). Indeed, estimates from 2019 suggest that as much as around 28-50% of the value of euro banknotes in circulation is used to store value in the euro area (Zamora-Pérez, 2021). The new survey data from 2022 indicate that people are keeping more cash reserves now than before (37% of euro area consumers in 2022, compared with 34% in 2019), as depicted in Chart 25. It could be that this was because of the pandemic and uncertainty in the economy, and a perceived need to keep cash on hand at home because it is portable, fungible, and immediately useful offline. Cash might also be habitual for some groups, and cash management is a useful way to keep track of a fixed budget (Financial Conduct Authority, 2021). In the euro area, Slovakia (58%) and Estonia (49%) ranked among the highest in the share of population reporting they keep extra cash on hand as a store of value. France (30%) and Cyprus (25%) ranked lowest. Cyprus also saw the highest share of the population refusing to answer whether they keep extra cash holdings – almost 10%. This shows that cash management can be a deeply personal issue for many people, and is in line with the 40% of people who like the anonymity cash affords them.

Note: The survey question was: “Do you personally keep extra cash that is not in your wallet, purse or pocket?”
Cash received as part of income could influence cash usage in transactions. The results show that most euro area citizens (85%) did not receive any regular income in cash (see Chart 26). This figure was marginally higher in 2019, at 87%. Greece was an outlier, in that 11% of people in that country received up to a quarter of their income in cash (roughly twice the euro area average of 5%); 8% received half and 9% received more than three-quarters. This indicates a stronger cash dependency in Greece than other Member States, at least in terms of willingness to accept cash as opposed to other options like direct deposit.

8 Consumer access to and acceptance of means of payment
Ensuring equitable access to cash is a fundamental part of the Eurosystem’s Cash 2030 Strategy. The overall number of ATMs per inhabitant has increased slightly, but only partly offset the continued closure of bank branches (Zamora-Pérez, 2022). However, in some euro area countries – most notably Belgium and the Netherlands – the ATM network has actually shrunk (Zamora-Pérez, 2022) leading to concerns about the ability of more vulnerable people to make payments. The Eurosystem also looks into how access for all citizens can be promoted in the payments sector, as part of its retail payments strategy.
[

]
With the payment mix undergoing continued changes, it is the role of the Eurosystem to ensure that people continue to have the freedom to pay wherever they want, irrespective of geographical location. Access to a given means of payment can be an important factor in determining how people decide to pay. Anticipating trends in changing payment behaviour and the logistical requirements needed to continue to provide cash is a way of upholding people’s universal right to public money should they choose to use it. Cash can be obtained from various sources: withdrawals in bank branches, from ATMs and from retailers via cashback services or cash-in-shop.
8.1 Access to cash
Access to cash withdrawals is a key way of measuring how much freedom of choice consumers ultimately have when making a payment. The ease with which it can be accessed may influence consumers’ propensity to choose cash when deciding what option to use from the range of payment methods available. When asked about their views on ease of access to cash withdrawals (Chart 27), half (50%) of the population polled said access to cash withdrawals was very easy, which is roughly similar to the results in 2019. Another 39% scored it as fairly easy while only 7% said it was fairly difficult and 3% found it very difficult.
Chart 27

Note: The survey question was: “When you need to withdraw cash, how easy or difficult do you usually find it to get to an ATM or a bank?”
Specifically on cash withdrawals (Chart 28), there was a worsening trend in the difficulty of obtaining cash from ATMs in some countries, especially Belgium (up 12 percentage points) and the Netherlands and Luxembourg (each up 7 percentage points). However, most countries across the euro area have seen a perceived increase in ease of access to cash withdrawals. Lithuania (minus 3 percentage points) and Estonia (minus 4 percentage points) both witnessed reductions in the difficulty of accessing an ATM, as did Slovenia (also minus 4 percentage points). Other countries to see modest gains include Greece (minus 1 percentage point); the most substantial improvement in ease of access to cash from ATMs was in Malta (minus 6 percentage points). In four countries (Ireland, France, Italy and Latvia), perceived ease of access remained stable.

Governing Council, Executive Board and Supervisory Board members bound by new restrictions on private financial transactions
Among new rules, high-level officials’ investments limited to broadly diversified funds with a medium to long-term perspective
Revised rules enhance accountability and transparency of ECB
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published an enhanced Code of Conduct for all high-level ECB officials. These new rules, prepared by the ECB’s independent Ethics Committee, impose additional restrictions on the private financial transactions of high-level ECB officials, including Governing Council, Executive Board and Supervisory Board members.
“The amendments to our Code of Conduct carry the full support of all high-level ECB officials and are a strong sign of our unwavering commitment to the ECB’s public mission, which is vital to secure the trust of the Europeans we serve,” says ECB President Christine Lagarde. “While the current Code has proven to be solid and effective, the new rules will bring the ECB’s ethics standards to the next level and ensure that we remain among the leading institutions in this area.”
Under the enhanced rules, high-level ECB officials must limit their investments to publicly listed, broadly diversified collective investment schemes such as exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. A collective investment scheme is considered broadly diversified if it is not concentrated in a specific sector. Asset classes that are already held and that, following the amendments, do not fall into this category may be kept as legacy assets. This means that no further purchases of these assets are allowed and that any sales of such assets would require the prior approval of the ECB’s Ethics Committee.
To further improve transparency, high-level officials will also publicly disclose all financial transactions undertaken during the last calendar year. This information will be published yearly on the ECB’s website, together with the Declarations of Interests. In the case of spouses and minor children, financial transactions above €10,000 during the last calendar year will be reported to the ECB’s Ethics Committee.
The enhanced rules also reinforce the principle of a medium to long-term investment horizon by extending the holding period for all assets from one month to at least one year and introducing a requirement of at least 30 days’ advance notice for transactions exceeding €50,000.
The new rules and principles aim to mitigate the risks of misuse of confidential information and possible conflicts of interest. The amendments to the rules for private financial transactions tighten the current regime with the aim of enhancing the ECB’s accountability and transparency.
The revised rules will apply from 1 January 2023 and will remain applicable to all high-level ECB officials for six months beyond the end of their term of office.
For media queries, please contact Clara Martín Marqués, tel.: +49 173 3790591.
Notes
The Code of Conduct for high-level ECB officials covers the members of the Governing Council, the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board, the General Council, the Audit Committee, the Ethics Committee and the Administrative Board of Review. It was first introduced in January 2019 and guides the management of possible conflicts of interest by introducing specific rules for post-employment activities, private financial transactions and relationships with interest groups. It also requires the publication of Declarations of Interests and monthly calendars, and it includes measures for pursuing cases of non-compliance."

ECB extends existing repo and swap lines with non-euro area central banks to 15 January 2024
Euro liquidity lines address possible liquidity needs in view of the economic and geopolitical situation and implications for financial markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to extend its temporary swap line with Poland as well as its temporary repo lines with the central banks of Albania, Andorra, Hungary, North Macedonia, Romania and San Marino. The size and operational parameters of the individual agreements will remain unchanged.
The swap and repo lines were due to expire on 15 January 2023 and are now extended until 15 January 2024. In the context of the persistent uncertainty stemming from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and the associated economic and financial repercussions on the global economy and financial markets, the lines are designed to prevent spillover effects in euro area financial markets and economies and safeguard the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy.
These bilateral swap and repo lines have been established since 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions via non-euro area central banks in view of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These temporary agreements complement the ECB’s standing swap lines and EUREP repo agreements. The EUREP facility was extended to 15 January 2024 as part of the ECB’s decisions communicated on 2 December 2022.
Under a repo line, a non-euro area central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral. Under a swap line, a non-euro area central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for its own currency, which is provided as collateral.

15 December 2022,"15 December 2022
The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and, based on the substantial upward revision to the inflation outlook, expects to raise them further. In particular, the Governing Council judges that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. The Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.
The key ECB interest rates are the Governing Council’s primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. The Governing Council today also discussed principles for normalising the Eurosystem’s monetary policy securities holdings. From the beginning of March 2023 onwards, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
At its February meeting the Governing Council will announce the detailed parameters for reducing the APP holdings. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions. By the end of 2023, the Governing Council will also review its operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which will provide information regarding the endpoint of the balance sheet normalisation process.
The Governing Council decided to raise interest rates today, and expects to raise them significantly further, because inflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above the target for too long. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, inflation was 10.0% in November, slightly lower than the 10.6% recorded in October. The decline resulted mainly from lower energy price inflation. Food price inflation and underlying price pressures across the economy have strengthened and will persist for some time. Amid exceptional uncertainty, Eurosystem staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections. They now see average inflation reaching 8.4% in 2022 before decreasing to 6.3% in 2023, with inflation expected to decline markedly over the course of the year. Inflation is then projected to average 3.4% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to be 3.9% on average in 2022 and to rise to 4.2% in 2023, before falling to 2.8% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025.
The euro area economy may contract in the current quarter and the next quarter, owing to the energy crisis, high uncertainty, weakening global economic activity and tighter financing conditions. According to the latest Eurosystem staff projections, a recession would be relatively short-lived and shallow. Growth is nonetheless expected to be subdued next year and has been revised down significantly compared with the previous projections. Beyond the near term, growth is projected to recover as the current headwinds fade. Overall, the Eurosystem staff projections now see the economy growing by 3.4% in 2022, 0.5% in 2023, 1.9% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 2.50%, 2.75% and 2.00% respectively, with effect from 21 December 2022.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP until the end of February 2023. Subsequently, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term. The Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

Compared with September:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months ahead increased further, while expectations for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged;
inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years;
expectations for both nominal spending and income growth over the next 12 months increased, and expected spending growth continued to outpace expected income growth;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months declined, whereas for unemployment in 12 months’ time they increased;
consumers expected the price of their home to grow less over the next 12 months, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to rise, with the median rate now standing at 9.9%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months increased from 5.1% to 5.4%, while expectations for inflation three years ahead were unchanged at 3.0%. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead edged up, remaining well above the level that prevailed before the start of the war in Ukraine. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Check out the inflation results)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 0.7% over the next 12 months, up from 0.6% in September, while expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months increased from 4.5% to 4.7%. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months also rose notably from 5.7% to 6.3%. Consumers’ expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups; younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents. (Check out the income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined from -2.4% in September to -2.6%. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead rose to 12.5%, up from 12.2% in September. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.7%). However, survey data available at a quarterly frequency showed that in October unemployed respondents raised their expected probability of finding a job in the next three months to 27.9%, up from 27.3% in July. Employed respondents, in turn, slightly reduced their expected probability of losing their job in the next three months to 9.2%, down from 9.4% in July. (Check out the labour market and growth results)
Housing and credit access. Consumers expected the growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to slow to 3.0% from 3.4% in September. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.7%, 1.4 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Both consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and their expectations of access to credit over the next 12 months tightened significantly. However, the share of consumers who report having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed quarterly, increased to 13.9% in October, up from 12.2% in July 2022.

Euro area firms saw continued improvement in business activity, but rising costs of materials, energy and labour weighed on their profitability. Turnover is still expected to increase over the next six months, but by less than had been expected in the previous survey round.
Lack of skilled labour and higher input costs were reported as the main concerns for firms of all sizes.
The financing gap widened, especially for large firms, as financing needs increased while the availability of external funds declined slightly. A rise in price terms and conditions of bank loans was reported by the highest number of firms since the survey started in 2009.
Despite tighter financing conditions, firms were not particularly concerned about their access to finance and reported no changes in banks’ willingness to lend. However, they expect the availability of external financing to deteriorate and anticipate that their internal funds will not be sufficient to meet their future financing needs.
In the latest round of the biannual Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, covering the period from April to September 2022, firms reported that business activity continued to improve, with increases in turnover reported more frequently among large enterprises than among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chart 1). However, production costs surged and the net percentage
[
1
]
of firms reporting an increase in the cost of raw materials and energy reached 93%, while an increase in labour costs was reported by a net 71% of firms. Both of these figures stand at new historical peaks – for the second survey round in a row. Owing to the rise in costs, profitability weakened, with both SMEs (net -19%) and large firms (-9%) reporting a decline in profits.
In this survey round, euro area firms signalled an increased need for financing across instruments, while indicating that their availability decreased. This resulted in a net 9% of firms reporting a widening of the financing gap. In terms of size classes, a wider financing gap was reported more often by larger companies (11%) than by SMEs (7%) (Chart 2). In addition, euro area firms reported a tightening of financing conditions, with a net 71% citing higher bank interest rates (up from 34% in the previous round) and a net 49% indicating a deterioration in other terms and conditions (i.e. charges, fees and commissions) (Chart 3). Comparable levels have not been observed in the SAFE since 2011. These developments are consistent with the euro area Bank Lending Survey for the second and third quarters of 2022, which indicate a tightening of collateral requirements and other terms and conditions, as well as a widening of margins applied to bank loans. Although firms in the SAFE indicated a substantial tightening of financing conditions, they reported no changes in banks’ willingness to provide credit. The net percentage of firms reporting obstacles to obtaining a bank loan remained broadly unchanged at 7%. Euro area firms expect a further deterioration in the availability of external financing in the coming six months, as well as a reduced capacity to meet their financing needs with internal funds.
This report published today presents the main results of the 27th round of the SAFE in the euro area, which was conducted between 7 September and 14 October 2022 and covers the period from April to September 2022. The sample comprised 10,984 firms, of which 10,006 (91.1%) are SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant (i.e. they have used it or considered using it). Respondents replying with “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages.

,"1 Overview of the results
This report presents the main results of the 27th round of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, which was conducted between 7 September and 14 October 2022. The survey covered the period from April to September 2022. The sample comprised 10,984 enterprises in the euro area, of which 10,006 (91.1%) had fewer than 250 employees.
[

Euro area enterprises continued to signal a recovery in business activity over the past six months (with 29% in net terms
[
2
]
reporting increases in turnover) (see Chart 1 in Section 2). This is the third round in which enterprises have recorded improvements in turnover since the declines observed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Across firm sizes, it appears that large companies are still experiencing a faster rebound than small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Firms still expect increases in turnover, but they have become less optimistic as the war in Ukraine continues and amid rising inflation (see Chart 18 in Section 5). A net 13% of euro area firms now expect turnover to increase over the next six months (down from 34% in the previous survey round).
Despite the ongoing growth in turnover, euro area firms’ profitability continued to weaken, both for SMEs and for large firms (see Chart 1 in Section 2). More SMEs reported a continued deterioration in profits in net terms (-19% compared with -15% in the previous round), while large firms signalled a decline in profits (-9%), having reported an increase in the previous survey round (15%).
The weaker profitability again reflected a widely reported rise in materials and energy costs as well as labour costs. A net 91% of firms (up from 89% in the previous round) reported higher costs for materials and energy. Meanwhile, a net 71% (up from 66%) signalled an increase in labour costs. The significant rise in production costs is widespread across both firm sizes and countries.
In this survey round, enterprises of all sizes reported that the lack of skilled labour and the rise in input costs were the dominant concerns for their business activity, while access to finance remained among the least-reported concerns (see Chart 4 in Section 2). The lack of skilled labour continued to be the main concern for euro area firms (29%), followed by the increase in the costs of production and labour (19%). At the same time, concerns about access to finance remained unchanged at a low level in the euro area (6%), while those about difficulty in finding customers declined (11%). Meanwhile, concerns about competition and regulatory burdens (both 7%) were relatively limited for enterprises in the euro area.
In net terms, euro area firms reported increased demand for external financing across instruments (see Table 1, columns 1-4 in this section and Chart 6 in Section 3.1). A net 9% of companies reported higher demand for bank loans (up from 5% in the previous survey round) and 16% for credit lines (up from 7%). The results are in line with those of the euro area Bank Lending Survey (BLS) for the second and third quarters of 2022, as well as being consistent with an acceleration in the overall growth in bank loans in the same period. The increased demand for external financing was also reported for other types of loans and equity. For most instruments, large firms reported increased demand for external financing more often than SMEs.
In addition, euro area firms reported that the availability of external financing had deteriorated slightly (see Table 1, columns 5-8 in this section and Chart 7 in Section 3.2). Specifically, firms reported (in net terms) a decline in the availability of bank loans (7%), credit lines (3%) and trade credit (4%). The availability of equity, leasing and other loans was reported to be broadly unchanged.
Firms’ higher financing needs along with lower availability of external funds resulted in a widening of the financing gap (see Table 1 in this section, columns 9-10 and Chart 8 in Section 3.2). In this survey round, 9% of firms reported a widening of the financing gap (up from 1%). Across size classes, large companies reported an increasing financing gap more often (11%) than SMEs (7%).

Notes: For the “financing gap”, see the notes to Chart 8; for “financing obstacles”, see the notes to Chart 12. “2021 H2” refers to round 26 (October 2021 – March 2022) and “2022 H1” refers to round 27 (April 2022-September 2022).
The outlook for economic activity, both at the aggregate level and at the firm level, was broadly perceived as deteriorating and thus hampering the availability of external financing (see Chart 10 in Section 4). A net 48% of firms reported a deterioration in the general economic outlook (compared with 29% in the previous round). Similarly, enterprises reported a further deterioration in firm-specific factors, such as outlook in terms of profits and turnover (-16%). By contrast, factors related to the capital position and creditworthiness (around 10%) were still having a positive impact on access to finance.
Euro area firms reported on balance that there had been no change in the willingness of banks to provide credit. However, while large companies continued to indicate that banks were taking a more positive attitude towards lending, for the first time since 2014 SMEs reported a slight deterioration in the willingness of banks to provide credit.
Despite the tightening in financing conditions, but in line with firms’ perceptions that access to finance was not the most important impediment for business activity, few firms reported obstacles to obtaining a bank loan, with percentages broadly unchanged from those of the previous survey rounds. The overall indicator
[

]
of obstacles preventing euro area enterprises from accessing bank loans remained unchanged at 7% (see Table 1, columns 11 and 12 in this section). In this survey round, the percentage of firms applying for bank loans remained unchanged (29%), with self-financing slightly declining. Most of the firms that applied were successful in obtaining the full amount requested, whether they were SMEs (62%) or large companies (73%), although these percentages were below the pre-COVID-19 levels.
In this survey round, most enterprises reported increases in bank interest rates and a considerable deterioration in other costs of financing, a pattern that was common to all firm sizes and countries (see Chart 15 in Section 4). Specifically, a net 71% of firms reported rises in bank interest rates (up from 34%). No comparable percentage has been observed in the replies to questions about the price terms and conditions of bank financing since the survey started in 2009, which points to a widespread tightening of financing conditions across firms. This development is in line with the tightening related to collateral requirements and other terms and conditions. It also reflects the widening of margins applied to bank loans reported in the euro area BLS for the second quarter of 2022 and, more recently, the third quarter as well.

A comprehensive indicator reflecting the price terms and conditions of financing provided to firms shows a deterioration across firm sizes (see Chart A in this section). This indicator – denoted in the chart by the abbreviated form “price T&C” – mainly covers changes in bank interest rates and other costs of bank financing (charges, fees and commissions), and is one of three main components summarising how euro area firms perceive financing conditions.
[

]
The recent deterioration (which is denoted by positive indicator values) is reported by about 40% of both SMEs and large firms – a level not seen since the survey was introduced in 2009. Another indicator, summarising financing conditions in terms of firms’ balance sheet quality (profits, own capital and creditworthiness) deteriorated slightly during this survey round, both for large firms (4%) and for SMEs (5%), mainly reflecting firms’ negative perceptions of their ability to obtain external finance (see Section 4). Finally, the indicator denoted in the chart by “non-price T&C” focuses mainly on factors such as collateral requirements and other terms of loans, but weighs also on banks’ willingness to provide credit. This indicator has deteriorated for small firms lately, while it points to easing conditions for larger firms. The reason for the difference is that, unlike SMEs, large firms reported an increase in banks’ willingness to provide credit.

b) Large firms
Notes: Indicator obtained by factor analysis. Positive values indicate a deterioration in firms’ financing conditions. For details, see the box entitled “Financing conditions through the lens of euro area companies”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 8, ECB, 2021. The individual scores are weighted by size class, economic activity and country to reflect the economic structure of the underlying population of firms. The individual scores are standardised, so they have a range of between -1 and 1 and are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted balances in percentages. The first vertical grey line denotes the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions; the second vertical grey line denotes the start of the first series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO I) and the negative interest rate policy; the third vertical grey line denotes the start of TLTRO II and the corporate sector purchase programme; the fourth denotes the start of the pandemic emergency purchase programme and TLTRO III; the last vertical grey vertical line denotes the rise of the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and approval of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in July 2022. Latest observation: April-September 2022.
Looking ahead, euro area firms are pessimistic regarding the availability of both internal and external financing (see Charts 16 and 17 in Section 5). Regarding external financing, firms are particularly pessimistic about access to bank loans and credit lines, with a net 31% and 25% of firms respectively expecting a deterioration over the next six months. At the same time, a net 8% of firms expect financing through internal funds to deteriorate.
Price terms and conditions are becoming an increasingly decisive factor in firms’ expectations of the future availability of bank loans. For all three indicators of financing conditions as perceived by firms, a tightening is associated with a deterioration in firms’ expectations about the future availability of bank loans (see Chart B). Since the outbreak of the pandemic, an increase in the indicator summarising price terms and conditions has been associated with an increasingly negative impact on firms’ expectations about the future availability of bank loans. Specifically, before the COVID-19 pandemic, a one standard deviation deterioration in price terms and conditions was associated with a 5% increase in the probability of an expected decline in bank loan availability. Since April 2021, the effect has increased to 9%. Overall, the empirical analysis shows not only that firms are more concerned about the rise in financing costs, but also that these concerns also translate more strongly into pessimism about the availability of finance. Among the three indicators of financing conditions, firms’ financial positions continue to have the largest marginal effect on firms’ expectations regarding the future availability of bank loans. Similar developments can be observed for the relationship between financial conditions and firms’ expectations about future turnover. While changes in financial conditions due to firms’ financial positions have historically had a strong effect on turnover, changes related to price terms and conditions have only become relevant for expected turnover in the most recent wave.

Contributions of the indicators of financing conditions to a deterioration in perceived future availability of bank loans
(average marginal effects, percentages)
Notes: Average marginal effects of the increase by one standard deviation in the principal components on a deterioration in the future availability of bank loans based on logit regressions. PC stands for “principal component”. PC 1 refers to firms’ financial positions; PC 2 to non-price terms and conditions; PC 3 to price terms and conditions. For details, see the box entitled “Financing conditions through the lens of euro area companies”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 8, ECB, 2021. Latest observation: April-September 2022.
Overall, the survey results suggest a continued improvement in business activity, as firms expect turnover to continue rising in the next six months, albeit to a lesser extent than in the previous round. Owing to higher production costs for energy, materials and labour, more firms reported a drop in profitability.
Euro area firms signalled an increase in their financing needs as well as lower availability, resulting in a widening of the financing gap, especially for large companies. In addition, the percentage of firms reporting a rise in the price terms and conditions of bank loans was the highest since the beginning of the survey in 2009.
Despite the tightening of financial conditions, firms were not too concerned about access to finance in this survey round and reported no changes in banks’ willingness to lend. However, euro area firms expect a further deterioration in the availability of external financing in the coming six months as well as reduced ability to compensate for their financing needs with internal funds.
2 The economic situation of euro area firms
2.1 Business activity continues to improve, but increasing costs weigh on profitability
Business activity continued to improve among euro area firms over the last six months (see Chart 1). The net percentage of euro area firms reporting an increase in turnover in the survey rose to 29% (from 25%). This net percentage reflects the rebound in economic activity observed during the summer months and is widespread across firm sizes, although somewhat more so for larger companies. The net percentage of large firms reporting turnover growth dropped to 45% in this round (from 51%), while the figure was 20% for SMEs (up from 11%).

Changes in the income situation of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022) for all firms and to rounds 20-27 (October 2018 -March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: Net percentages are the difference between the percentage of enterprises reporting an increase for a given factor and the percentage reporting a decrease. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
At the same time, euro area enterprises reported continued increases in materials and energy costs, as well as labour costs. A very high proportion of euro area firms reported rises in materials and energy costs (93%, up from 89%) and in labour costs (71%, up from 66%), with the net percentage of firms reporting an increase in both types of costs standing at a new historical peak in the survey.
Similarly, firms reported an increase in interest expenses, in line with the upward trend in the cost of bank credit. The survey replies indicate a sustained pass-through from higher actual and expected policy rates to bank lending rates but with some differences across firm sizes. Large firms (36%, up from 5%) reported increased interest expenses more often than SMEs (27%, up from 14%).
Owing to rising costs, euro area firms’ profitability weakened further, despite the ongoing expansion in turnover. The net percentage of euro area corporations that signalled a decline in their profits over the last six months increased strongly (net -16%, from -4% in the previous wave). This negative development is shared by both SMEs and large companies. While SMEs continued to report on balance that profits had deteriorated (-19%, from -15%), large firms signalled a turning point in this survey round, with a net 9% of them signalling a decline in profits (from 15% signalling an increase in the previous survey round).
Across countries, trends in firms’ business activity have followed similar patterns in the past six months (see Chart 19 in Annex 1). The net share of firms reporting an expansion in turnover was very similar across the largest euro area countries. The deterioration in profits was somewhat more broadly reported by Italian and Spanish firms (net -24% and -20% respectively compared with -16% for all euro area firms). Changes in labour costs were similar across the large countries, except for Italy, where increases were less frequently reported (net 51% compared with 71% for all euro area firms).

Changes in the debt situation and real decisions of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 11-27 of the survey (March 2014-September 2014 to April 2022-September 2022) for all firms and to rounds 20-27 (October 2018 -March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
In net terms, euro area firms reported no change in debt-to-assets ratios in this survey round, but patterns diverged to some extent across euro area countries (see Chart 20 in Annex 1). In this survey round, euro area firms indicated on balance that there had been no change in their indebtedness (from a net 3% reporting a decline in the previous round – see Chart 2). However, while German and Spanish firms continued to report slight decreases in debt-to-assets ratios, French and, to an even greater extent, Italian firms signalled increases (see Chart 20).
Firms’ investment and employment growth has broadly held up, but with some heterogeneity. A net percentage of euro area enterprises reported increases in fixed investment (12%, down from 16%), inventories and working capital (17%, up from 15%) and number of employees (14%, down from 16%). The growth in fixed investment, inventories, and employment was more widely reported among large firms.
Growth in inventories and working capital were widespread across countries. In this survey round, German firms continued to report increases in inventories (24%) more broadly than firms in the other countries (around 10-15%). At the same time, increases in fixed investment were signalled most by Spanish, French and Italian firms (all 15%) than by German firms (7%).
The financial vulnerability of euro area enterprises has increased for both SMEs and large firms (see Chart 3). The financial vulnerability indicator, a comprehensive indicator of firms’ financial situation
[
7
]
, suggests that 6% of euro area enterprises encountered major difficulties in running their businesses and servicing their debts over the past six months. The increase in this survey round is more noticeable for large firms, with the percentage jumping from 2% to 5%. Meanwhile, 6% of SMEs can now be considered vulnerable (a minor increase). Moreover, financial vulnerability remains somewhat above its average levels prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. At the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of profitable firms (i.e. those that are more likely to be resilient to adverse shocks) fell to slightly below 4% overall. This was due to a sharp drop in the number of profitable large firms.
Chart 3
Vulnerable and profitable enterprises in the euro area
(percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022) for all firms and to rounds 18-27 (October 2017-March 2018 to April 2022-September 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: For definitions, see footnote 7. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
The financial vulnerability indicator increased for German firms in particular (see Chart 21 in Annex 1). The percentage of vulnerable companies remained roughly constant in Spain (7%), Italy (7%) and France (4%), while it increased markedly in Germany (6%, up from 3%). By contrast, profitability decreased across the four largest economies in this survey round, in line with the euro area aggregate.
2.2 Euro area enterprises remain more concerned about staff availability and production costs than about access to finance
The availability of skilled labour and the rise in production costs have remained the main concern for euro area enterprises (see Chart 4). Even though slightly fewer euro area firms were most concerned about the availability of skilled labour, it remained the most pressing concern overall (signalled by 29% of firms, down from 30%). This remains in line with recent employment readings indicating general labour shortages as limitations to production. Production costs were more often reported as the main concern (19%, up from 18%), remaining the second most important concern for euro area enterprises. By contrast, difficulty in finding customers (11%, down from 16%), regulation and competition (both 7%, down from 8%) moderated again with respect to the previous survey rounds. These developments were common to both SMEs and large firms.
Companies’ main concerns differ across the largest euro area countries (see Chart 22 in Annex 1). Compared with the euro area average, German firms responding to the survey were particularly concerned about the availability of skilled labour (35%) but were less concerned about production costs (14%). By contrast, Italian and Spanish firms were more concerned about production costs (25% and 22%) and less concerned about the availability of skilled labour (both 18%).

Notes: The data included in the chart refer to Question 0b of the survey.
Despite the recent increases in the cost of borrowing, euro area firms were still not too concerned about access to finance. In the euro area, only 6% of firms reported access to finance as the main factor limiting production. This percentage remained broadly in line with pre-pandemic levels. In addition, firms reported that they were marginally less concerned about access to finance in this survey round compared with the last one (see Chart 5).

Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 18-27 of the survey (October 2017-March 2018 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: Enterprises were asked to indicate how important a specific problem was on a scale of 1 (not at all important) to 10 (extremely important). On the chart, the scale has been divided into three categories: low (1-3), medium (4-6) and high importance (7-10). The weighted average score is an average of the responses using the weighted number of respondents. The data included in the chart refer to Question 0b of the survey.
3 Demand for and availability of external financing
3.1 Increased demand for external financing across instruments
In net terms, euro area firms reported a considerable increase in the demand for external financing (see Chart 6). A net 9% of companies reported higher demand for bank loans
[
8
]
(up from 5% in the previous survey round), while 16% reported increased demand for credit lines (up from 7%). The results are in line with the Bank Lending Survey for the second and third quarters of 2022, as well as the overall growth in bank loans recorded in the euro area since April 2022. At the same time, net demand for trade credit and leasing or hire-purchase continued to increase (16% and 15% respectively), as did demand for other loans (mainly informal loans from family and friends, a related enterprise or shareholders), as well as equity and debt securities. The increased demand signals the need for firms to diversify their external financing as the cost of such financing is increasing across instruments, albeit at a different pace in each case. In this survey round, the increased demand for external financing was reported more often by large firms than SMEs for most instruments.
Chart 6
Changes in external financing needs of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 20-27 of the survey (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 of the survey.
Demand for bank loans and credit lines continued to increase at a higher pace across most countries, although it remained below the peak reached during the first phase of the pandemic (see Chart 24 in Annex 1). The increase in net demand for bank loans was higher for French firms (15%), while needs for credit lines were more pronounced for German firms (22%).
3.2 Lower availability of external financing, mainly because of the deterioration in the economic outlook
3.2.1 Declining availability of bank loans across firm sizes and countries contributed to a widening of the financing gap
Firms reported a deterioration in the availability of most external financing sources relevant to their business (see Chart 7).
[
9
]
The net percentages of firms reporting a deterioration in the availability of bank loans and credit lines were 7% and 3% respectively. This was the first sizeable net decrease in bank loan availability since 2014 and stands in contrast to the results of the previous survey round, in which firms reported increased availability of both bank loans and credit lines. In addition, firms signalled a decrease in the availability of trade credit over the past six months (4%). The availability of equity, other loans and leasing was reported to be roughly unchanged, while the availability of debt securities dropped quite significantly. Similar developments were reported across size classes and countries (see Chart 26 in Annex 1).
Chart 7
Changes in the availability of external financing for euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 20-27 of the survey (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 9 of the survey.
Firms’ increased needs for external finance combined with lower availability resulted in a widening of the financing gap (see Chart 8). In the euro area, the external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the supply of external financing – reached 9% (compared with 1% in the previous round). Among large companies, the external financing gap increased for a net 11% of firms (compared with 7% for SMEs), which is a new peak in the survey. In the last survey round, large firms reported on balance that there had been a slight decrease in the financing gap (-2%), while SMEs reported a similar sized net increase (2%). Among the largest euro area countries, the financing gap increased most broadly in France (16%) and Germany (10%). The change in the financing gap reported by German firms was by far the largest recorded in the history of the survey (see also Chart 27 in Annex 1).
Chart 8
Changes in the external financing gaps reported by euro area enterprises
(weighted net balances)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant (i.e. they have used it or considered using it). Respondents replying with “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 and Question 9.
3.3 Euro area firms used financing primarily for fixed investment and for inventories and working capital
Financing from external and internal sources continued to be used mainly for fixed investment and for inventories and working capital (see Chart 9). Although fixed investment was reported as the most common purpose of financing (42% of firms), the percentage fell compared with the last survey round (47%), bringing it close to the levels observed during the first phase of the pandemic. This could reflect the incipient slowdown in economic activity (see Section 2). Financing was reported to be used for inventories and capital for 40% of firms, making it the second most common purpose. Across size classes, more large companies than SMEs used external finance for fixed investment (57% compared with 33%) and for working capital and inventories (51% compared with 33%), which might be due to large companies having greater capacity to build up precautionary inventories.
Chart 9

(percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 20-27 of the survey (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022).
Note: The data included in the chart refer to Question 6A.
In all the largest euro area countries, fewer firms used financing for fixed investment, although it continues to be a more common purpose of financing among German firms (51%). German firms increasingly used financing for inventories and working capital (also 51%), while this purpose of financing declined in Spain, Italy and France (see Chart 25 in Annex 1).
4 Factors affecting financing conditions and financing obstacles
4.1 Euro area enterprises perceived the economic outlook as negatively affecting their ability to obtain external finance
The outlook for economic activity, both at aggregate level and at firm level, was broadly reported as an important factor hampering the availability of external financing (see Chart 10). In this survey round, euro area firms reported that changes in the general economic outlook had had a very strong negative impact on their access to finance (net -48% of firms, from -29%). Similarly, enterprises reported a further deterioration in firm-specific factors, such as the outlook in terms of profits and turnover (-16%, from -2%). Across size classes, a higher percentage of large companies than SMEs signalled a negative impact from both macroeconomic and firm-specific factors. By contrast, factors related to capital position (10%, down from 15%) and creditworthiness (12%, down from 16%) were still having a positive impact on access to finance. This may reflect the ongoing efforts of companies to restore their equity capital buffers and thus become more resilient to economic shocks.
Chart 10
Changes in factors that have an impact on the availability of external financing to euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 20-27 of the survey (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 11 of the survey.
Among the largest euro area countries, the most pessimistic perceptions on the general economic environment came from Spanish and German companies. In net terms, 59% of Spanish and 53% of German companies reported a negative impact from the general economic outlook. German firms were also the most pessimistic about their own specific outlook (see Chart 28 in Annex 1).
Euro area firms reported on balance that there had been no change in the willingness of banks to provide credit, although SMEs indicated a slight deterioration (see Chart 11). While large companies continued to indicate that banks were taking a more positive attitude towards lending, for the first time since 2014 SMEs indicated a deterioration in the willingness of banks to provide credit. There were small differences across countries: while Italian and German firms continued to report on balance that there had been a narrow improvement in banks’ willingness to provide credit, Spanish firms indicated a deterioration (see Chart 29 in Annex 1).
Enterprises reported more broadly that public financial support was playing a decreasing role in easing access to finance (see Chart 11). Reflecting the phasing-out of several support measures across the euro area, a net 15% of euro area firms considered the access of grants or subsidised loans to have declined. Looking at firm size, SMEs were more pessimistic than large firms in this respect. At country level, this perception was most widespread among Spanish firms (see Chart 29 in Annex 1).
Chart 11
Changes in factors that have an impact on the availability of external financing to euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises; for the category “willingness of banks to lend”, enterprises for which at least one bank financing instrument (credit line, bank overdraft, credit card overdraft, bank loan or subsidised bank loan) is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 20-27 of the survey (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 11.
4.2 Few firms reported obstacles to obtaining a bank loan
Despite the tightening of financing conditions, but in line with firms’ perceptions that access to finance was not the most important impediment for business activity, few firms reported obstacles to obtaining a bank loan, with percentages broadly similar to those recorded in the previous survey rounds (see Chart 12, panel a). Among enterprises that judged bank loans to be relevant for their funding, 7% faced obstacles when obtaining a loan (as in the previous survey round), while among SMEs the percentage remained slightly higher at 8%. Across countries, looking at the different components of financing obstacles, there were slight increases overall in the percentages of firms that either saw their applications rejected or received only part of the loan. The increases were strongest in Spain but were also seen in Germany and France (see Chart 30 in Appendix 1).
Chart 12
Obstacles to obtaining a bank loan
(percentages of respondents)
Panel a: Euro area enterprises
Panel b: Euro area SMEs and large enterprises
Base: Enterprises for which bank loans (including subsidised bank loans) are relevant. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: Financing obstacles are defined here as the total of the percentages of enterprises reporting (i) loan applications that were rejected, (ii) loan applications for which only a limited amount was granted, (iii) loan applications that resulted in an offer that was declined by the enterprise because the borrowing costs were too high and (iv) a decision not to apply for a loan for fear of rejection (discouraged borrowers).
The percentage of firms applying for bank loans remained unchanged, with self-financing declining slightly (see Chart 13). According to figures based only on enterprises that deemed bank loans to be relevant for their business, 29% of firms reported having applied for a loan (unchanged). Only 22% of SMEs applied, with 44% reporting that they did not apply because they had sufficient internal funds available. By contrast, a higher percentage of large companies applied for bank loans (41%, up from 37%) in response to a depletion of internal funds. Most of the firms that applied were successful in obtaining the full amount requested, whether they were SMEs (62%) or large companies (73%), although these percentages declined to pre-COVID-19 levels (see Chart 14).

Notes: The data included in the chart refer to Question 7B of the survey.
4.3 Significant tightening of financing conditions, with increases in price terms and conditions for bank loans
In this survey round, almost all firms across size classes and countries reported a rise in bank interest rates, alongside a considerable increase in other costs of financing (see Chart 15). The net percentage of firms reporting higher bank rates jumped to 71% (up from 34% in the previous round). No comparable percentage has been observed since the beginning of the survey in 2009, which points to a widespread tightening of financing conditions across firms. This development partly reflects the tightening of monetary policy and is in line with the widening of margins applied to bank loans reported in the euro area Bank Lending Survey (BLS) for the second quarter of 2022 and, more recently, the third quarter as well. At the same time, a net 49% of firms, up from a net 37%, also reported increases in other costs of financing (i.e. charges, fees and commissions). Again, this percentage reached historical highs within the survey period. The rises in bank interest rates and other costs of bank loans appear to be broadly similar across SMEs and large firms. Firms also reported stricter collateral requirements, while more firms indicated increases in the maturity of loans and in the size of loans.
Among the largest euro area countries, Spanish and German firms reported increases in bank interest rates the most frequently (see Chart 33 in Appendix 1). The broad increase in interest rates was widespread across countries, ranging from a net 66% increase in Italy to a net 82% increase in Spain.

Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 10.
5 Expectations regarding access to finance and turnover
5.1 Firms expect a substantial deterioration in their access to external financing
Euro area firms were pessimistic about the availability of most sources of external financing, especially financing from banks (see Chart 16). A relatively high percentage of firms reported a deterioration in the expected availability of bank loans and credit lines (31% and 25% respectively) over the next six months. The expected deterioration was common not only across size classes but also across countries (see Chart 34 in Annex 1). This reflects the prevailing economic uncertainty and the tightening credit stance of banks. Similarly, firms indicated a deterioration in their access to trade credit (-21%, from -13%), while large firms in particular were concerned about the prospects for issuing debt securities (with a net 35% expecting lower availability over the next six months).
Chart 16

Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 9 and Question 23 of the survey.
In addition to the expected reduction in availability of external finance, firms were also pessimistic about retained earnings as a means of financing their future business (see Chart 17). Across size classes, a net 8% of firms expected internal funds as a source of financing to deteriorate over the next six months. This is in line with firms’ expectations about future profitability (see Section 2).

Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 20-27 of the survey (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 23 of the survey.
While firms still expect turnover to increase, they are less optimistic than in the last survey round (see Chart 18 in the report). A net 13% of euro area firms (down from 34% in the previous survey round) continue to expect an increase in turnover over the next six months. Expectations of future turnover have declined significantly during 2022, probably owing to the war in Ukraine and to rising inflation. Although firms across countries and size classes have become less optimistic regarding future turnover, more large firms (net 25%) than SMEs (net 6%) expect turnover to increase. Among the four largest euro area economies, German firms were the least optimistic (see Chart 36 in Appendix 1).

Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 and Question 9.

(percentages of respondents)
Base: Enterprises for which bank loans (including subsidised bank loans) are relevant for rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: Financing obstacles are defined here as the total of the percentages of enterprises reporting (i) loan applications that were rejected, (ii) loan applications for which only a limited amount was granted, (iii) loan applications that resulted in an offer that was declined by the enterprise because the borrowing costs were too high, and (iv) a decision not to apply for a loan for fear of rejection (discouraged borrowers). The calculation of the indicator starts in 2010, when the question on applications for credit lines was first included in the questionnaire. The components of the financing obstacles indicator were affected by the amendments to the questionnaire in round 11 (filtering based on the relevance of the financing instrument and addition of the new category “my application is still pending”), and past data have been revised accordingly. These figures include the categories “my application is still pending” and “don’t know”.

Launch of Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) rescheduled from 20 November 2023 to 8 April 2024
Additional time will help mitigate impact of rescheduled T2 launch
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank has decided to reschedule the launch of the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) from 20 November 2023 to 8 April 2024. This decision was taken to mitigate the impact of the rescheduled launch of T2, the Eurosystem’s new real-time gross settlement system and central liquidity management model, which was postponed by four months on 20 October 2022.
The ECMS will be a unified system for managing assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. It will replace the existing individual systems of the euro area national central banks. The ECMS is expected to deliver considerable benefits to the Eurosystem and its counterparties and to the market at large by harmonising collateral management practices and contributing to further EU financial integration.

Households and firms face multiple challenges, including weakening economic outlook, higher inflation and tighter financial conditions
Diminished market liquidity raises risk of disorderly asset price adjustments, which could test investment fund resilience
Governments should ensure support to vulnerable sectors is targeted and does not interfere with monetary policy normalisation
Risks to financial stability in the euro area have increased amid soaring energy prices, elevated inflation and low economic growth, the November 2022 Financial Stability Review published today by the European Central Bank (ECB) shows. At the same time, financial conditions have tightened as central banks act to rein in inflation.
“People and firms are already feeling the impact of rising inflation and the slowdown in economic activity,” said ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos. “Our assessment is that risks to financial stability have increased, while a technical recession in the euro area has become more likely.”
These recent developments are increasing the vulnerability of households, firms and governments that hold more debt. They are also adding to financial market stresses and testing the resilience of investment funds. Moreover, all of these vulnerabilities could unfold simultaneously, potentially reinforcing one another.
Corporate sector challenges have grown amid higher energy and other input costs, with profits expected to decline as funding costs increase. If the outlook deteriorates further, an increase in the frequency of corporate defaults cannot be excluded, particularly among energy-intensive firms.
Inflation, as well as soaring gas and electricity bills, is also hitting households, decreasing their purchasing power and potentially reducing their ability to repay loans. Lower-income households that generally spend a greater share of their income on energy and food are particularly affected.
As firms and households find it increasingly challenging to service their debts, banks could face higher credit losses in the medium term. While the banking sector has recently seen a recovery in profitability as interest rates have risen, there are incipient signs of asset quality deterioration, which may require larger provisions.
Many governments have been providing fiscal support to firms and households to soften the impact of rising energy prices. However, high levels of government debt following the pandemic, paired with tighter funding conditions, limit the scope for fiscal expansion measures that do not trigger risks to debt sustainability. Support should therefore be temporary and targeted at those most affected.
Uncertainty around the outlook for inflation and interest rates has heightened the risk of disorderly asset price adjustment in financial markets, notwithstanding recent corrections. Many investment funds remain heavily exposed to further valuation and credit losses. Those with large structural liquidity mismatches and low cash buffers are particularly vulnerable to market dislocations and the outflow of funding. Diminished liquidity in some financial markets could also pose challenges for adjusting portfolios or raising funds. It also raises the risk of unexpectedly large margin calls, which could aggravate adverse market dynamics if funds are forced to sell assets to meet them.
Overall, the euro area banking system is well placed to withstand many risks, in part because of the regulatory and prudential policy reforms of the past decade. Given the deterioration of the economic and financial outlook, targeted macroprudential policies such as capital buffers can help to further strengthen the resilience of the financial system.
Persistent vulnerabilities and risks in the non-bank financial sector require close attention from relevant supervisors. Urgent progress on regulatory frameworks is needed to enhance the resilience of the sector, especially to address liquidity mismatches and leverage.

,"Foreword
Households and firms across the euro area are already feeling the effects of higher inflation and weaker economic activity, amid the ongoing energy crisis prompted by the war in Ukraine.
The November 2022 Financial Stability Review (FSR) sets out how the deterioration in economic and financial conditions has increased the risks to euro area financial stability. This year has seen notable declines in financial asset prices across many regions and asset classes, an increase in market volatility and, at times, strained market liquidity. Sharp asset price movements have also triggered unexpectedly large margin calls for some market participants, notably non-financial corporations and non-bank financial institutions, testing their liquidity preparedness. These asset price shifts have reflected increasing uncertainty about what will be required of monetary policy to moderate inflation in advanced economies. Not for the first time, we have been reminded that, when positions are leveraged or when exposures are created through derivatives, the impacts of market shocks are often felt well beyond those investors that are directly affected.
As financial conditions tighten, the vulnerabilities of more-indebted sovereigns, households and corporates are at greater risk of coming to the fore. Despite the pandemic-induced disruption of economic activity, corporate defaults and unemployment have, thanks to a variety of policy support measures, remained low. Banks have thus been shielded from loan losses. While they are now benefiting from near-term gains derived from higher interest rates and margins, deteriorating growth prospects point to rising risks in the medium term. With the present macroeconomic environment, where monetary policy is focused on lowering inflation, it is crucial for governments to be targeted in the support they provide to vulnerable sectors, while avoiding policies that could interfere with the monetary policy normalisation process.
This issue of the FSR also includes three special features on topics that are becoming more prominent for our risk assessment. The first examines the impact of the energy crisis on energy-related financial derivatives markets, which are used by energy producers across the euro area to hedge their positions and intermediated by the banking system and clearing houses. The second special feature explores how increasing energy and other prices, together with rising interest rates, are affecting euro area households at different income levels, and the challenges posed for less well-off households in particular. The third special feature looks at how threats to financial stability from cyberattacks are evolving, how their costs are rising, and how this can be mitigated.
This issue of the FSR has been prepared with the involvement of the ESCB Financial Stability Committee, which assists the decision-making bodies of the ECB in the ful?lment of their tasks. The FSR promotes awareness of systemic risks among policymakers, the ?nancial industry and the public at large, with the ultimate goal of promoting financial stability.
Luis de Guindos
Vice-President of the European Central Bank
Overview
Financial stability risks increase as macro-financial conditions continue to weaken
Euro area financial stability conditions have deteriorated further, reflecting rising inflation, higher interest rates, weaker growth prospects and financial market repricing. Inflationary pressures have risen both globally and in the euro area since the publication of the previous FSR (Chart 1, panel a), driven by elevated food and energy prices and their pass-through to other prices. This has prompted an adjustment of monetary policy stances by major central banks, contributing to tighter global financial conditions and increased financial market volatility. The mix of high inflation outturns and rising interest rates has continued to weigh on economic growth in many advanced economies. Against this background, one-year ahead recession probabilities have increased markedly, in both the euro area and other major advanced economies (Chart 1, panel b).

Notes: Panel a: Bloomberg’s financial conditions indices measure stress in money, bond and equity markets relative to the period before the global financial crisis. Positive values indicate accommodative financing conditions, while negative values indicate tighter financing conditions. EA stands for euro area; HICP stands for Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices; CPI stands for consumer price index. Panel b: recession probabilities are displayed as the Bloomberg Recession Probability Forecast Index. Recession probabilities for emerging market economies are the median Bloomberg Recession Probability Forecast Index for a set of countries defined as emerging market economies in alignment with the IMF, excluding Ukraine and Russia.
Pre-existing vulnerabilities could be exposed by euro area economic developments, monetary and fiscal policy challenges and geopolitical tensions. The ongoing war in Ukraine still poses a significant risk to inflation and growth, especially if it leads to euro area households and firms facing rationed energy supplies. Other risks to inflation, growth and global financial conditions could also be triggered by a faster than expected rise in interest rates, fiscal policy missteps, a broader resurgence of the pandemic, and emerging market stress, including the possibility of a sharper economic slowdown or real estate correction in China. Should any of these risks materialise, they could trigger or amplify the unravelling of financial stability vulnerabilities identified in previous issues of the FSR, possibly simultaneously, including pockets of debt sustainability concerns for corporates, households and sovereigns, or abrupt adjustments in both financial and tangible asset valuations.
Risk of disorderly market adjustments rises amid higher volatility and potential for further asset repricing
Despite large corrections in 2022, risky-asset valuations remain sensitive to the uncertain path of inflation, monetary policy normalisation and economic activity. After a brief summer rally, global bond and equity markets resumed their simultaneous decline that has been under way since the start of 2022 (Chart 2, panel a). While recent corrections have generally been orderly, there has been unusually strong price co-movement across a wide range of asset classes – a development that complicates diversification strategies and could amplify losses (Box 2). Activity in primary markets – including initial public offerings of equity and issuance of high-yield corporate bonds – has also fallen significantly year on year.
Some risky-asset prices, such as US equities, still appear stretched given fundamentals. So far, asset prices declines have mainly reflected the direct impact of higher interest rates, and, therefore, prices may not yet fully reflect the more negative outlook. Further corrections in market valuations could be triggered if the outlook for growth, inflation and financial conditions deteriorates further. In particular, more persistent inflation might require further monetary policy responses by major central banks than currently expected by market participants.
The risk of disorderly adjustments has risen with increased market volatility, knock-on effects for margin demands and lower liquidity in some market segments. Significant financial market repricing has translated into higher market volatility, in particular – but not exclusively – in bond markets (Chart 2, panel b). In addition, some signs of lower market liquidity have emerged in euro area corporate bond markets, especially for high-yield bonds (Chart 2, panel c). This could make it harder for participants to adjust portfolios, reprice assets or raise financing in periods of stress. Furthermore, the cash and collateral stress that can arise from large price moves and volatility that trigger unexpectedly large margin calls poses a risk for some derivatives market participants, as recently seen in euro area commodity derivatives markets (Special Feature A) and UK sovereign debt markets. This combination of developments makes markets more vulnerable to disorderly adjustments.

Panel c: bid-ask spreads are weighted by market value for euro-denominated bonds included in the iBoxx investment-grade, high-yield and sovereign bond indices with original maturity of one year.
Despite some active portfolio de-risking, the credit risk exposure of the non-bank financial intermediary sector remains high. Non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) have responded to rising yields and a worsening macroeconomic outlook by starting to offload their holdings of lower-rated corporate and sovereign bonds (Chart 3, panel a). This points to a reversal of the search for yield observed in the prolonged low interest rate environment (Section 4.1). That said, overall exposures to credit risk remain high, exposing NBFIs to the risk of substantial credit losses should corporate sector fundamentals deteriorate. In this regard, the credit risk outlook remains particularly uncertain for energy-sensitive industries. While aggregate exposures to these sectors are not large, concentrated exposures may increase risks, especially for leveraged and liquidity-constrained NBFIs. In addition to liquidity needs from investor redemptions, insurance policy lapses and margin calls, the broad-based correction of financial asset prices has been the main driver of a significant decline in the total value of assets in the non-bank financial sector.
NBFIs are exposed to a further rise in bond yields and possible forced asset sales amid low liquid asset holdings. In a context of rising bond yields, NBFIs’ duration risk remains elevated, exposing the sector to further bond portfolio revaluation losses. That said, in the medium term, the transition to a higher interest rate environment could, in addition to reducing the incentives for NBFIs to search for yield, benefit the life insurance and pension fund sector because of their structural negative duration gaps (with the duration of liabilities typically exceeding that of their assets) (Section 4.3 and Box 4). While the cash holdings of investment funds have risen since early 2022 (Chart 3, panel b), their holdings of liquid assets remain relatively low amid rising volatility and the lack of a sufficiently developed macroprudential approach for addressing liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds. As such, the risk remains high that investment funds could, in an adverse scenario, amplify a market correction via procyclical selling behaviour. In addition, NBFIs which use interest rate derivatives, including insurance companies and pension funds (Section 4.1 and Box 3), are exposed to funding liquidity risk from unexpectedly large margin calls. Subsequent forced asset sales could worsen a market sell-off and increase wider risks to financial stability.

Panel b: the latest data point is an estimate assuming total assets remained constant from August 2022. Cash holdings are defined as deposits vis-à-vis euro area investment funds other than money market funds reported by monetary financial institutions excluding the ESCB in the euro area divided by total assets of euro area investment funds.
Higher funding costs and less fiscal space for sovereigns
Sovereign vulnerabilities have increased amid ongoing fiscal support to cushion the impact of higher energy prices and a weaker economic outlook. Euro area governments have spent around 1.4% of GDP on discretionary measures since the invasion of Ukraine (Section 1.2). Most of this reflects support to cushion the rise in energy prices and inflation, and several governments have announced extensions to energy support into 2023. This sizeable stimulus comes at a time when governments had only just ended pandemic-related support measures and when the normalisation of the monetary policy stance has started. Prolonged high deficits in a number of countries (Chart 4, panel a), coupled with rising funding costs, may not only limit the fiscal space available to shelter the economy from future shocks, but may also put debt dynamics on a less favourable trajectory, especially in countries with higher levels of debt. To preserve debt sustainability and limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures, support measures should be temporary and targeted towards the most vulnerable households and firms.

Downside risks to public finances have risen further as fragmentation concerns resurface amid energy price support and a slowing economy
Sources: IMF (Fiscal Monitor), Refinitiv and ECB calculations.
Notes: Panel a: figures for 2022-24 are projections. Panel b: ten-year sovereign bond yields are shown as at the last day in the reference period.
Resurgent concerns that some countries could face excessive increases in sovereign financing costs have been partly mitigated by policy action. On the funding side, government bond yields have increased sharply across the euro area over the past six months. In recent years, though, many sovereigns have locked in a greater fraction of their financing at low interest rates and longer maturities, reducing their vulnerability to abrupt shifts in market sentiment. However, higher funding costs may still represent a greater near-term risk for those countries with high short-term debt servicing needs. Short-term market pressures increased in a number of countries in early summer, as tighter financing conditions spurred fragmentation concerns in euro area sovereign debt markets (Box 1). Since then, the widening of sovereign yield spreads has stabilised (Chart 4, panel b), as reinvestment flexibility under the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme was exploited and the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) was approved by the ECB’s Governing Council on 21 July 2022. This new tool is designed to counter any unwarranted and disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.
Low growth, high inflation and rising rates are exposing corporate and household vulnerabilities
Euro area firms are challenged by high inflation and energy prices, recession risks and tighter financial conditions. On aggregate, in the first half of 2022 euro area corporates saw profitability return above pre-pandemic levels (Chapter 1.3), as firms were still able to pass on higher input prices to customers. However, a weaker economic outlook and, for some firms, growing margin pressures have seen corporate earnings growth expectations turn negative in real terms recently – a development previously observed during the global financial crisis and the pandemic (Chart 5, panel a). At the same time, euro area firms face challenges from higher market-based and bank funding costs. There are also signs of corporates switching from bonds to bank loans, given a faster pass-through of policy rate increases to bond yields. That said, the ongoing tightening of credit supply, coupled with the deterioration of economic prospects, indicates that bank lending volumes may soon moderate too.

Notes: Panel b: expected default frequencies shown are monthly averages of sectoral medians for publicly listed firms in euro area countries. Direct and indirect energy use is measured by the share of input from mining and quarrying, energy-producing products, coke and refined petroleum products and the electricity, gas, steam and air-conditioning industries for each sector, classified according to the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification for All Economic Activities (ISIC), Rev. 4. “High energy use” refers to the sectors with energy use in the 75th percentile, “Low energy use” refers to The energy use for the sector mining/quarrying is measured as the energy use in mining and quarrying, non-energy producing products and mining support service activities.the sectors with energy use in the 25th percentile and “Median energy use” refers to the sectors with energy use in between the 25th and 75th percentile.
Corporate vulnerabilities are greater for energy-intensive firms which may face growing debt servicing problems. A sharper economic slowdown, together with a further tightening of financing conditions, may in particular challenge those firms that exited the pandemic with higher debt levels, more subdued earnings and lower liquidity buffers – many of which also have lower credit ratings. At the same time, higher energy and commodity prices could hurt activity in those energy-intensive sectors that are less able to pass on higher costs to customers, such as some utility and construction firms. Small and medium-sized enterprises benefited less from the post-pandemic rebound in economic activity and may be particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity and higher borrowing costs. While corporate insolvencies have remained well below their pre-pandemic levels, some sectors have already seen an increase in expected default rates (Chart 5, panel b) and might be at greater risk of insolvencies in the event of adverse economic surprises or of a further tightening of financial conditions, or both.

Deteriorating financial position of euro area households may be made worse by a turn of the real estate cycle

The FTSE EPRA Nareit Eurozone Residential Index is used here to calculate the relative performance against the EURO STOXX 50 index.
High inflation is weighing on the disposable income and debt servicing capacity of lower-income euro area households in particular. Against the backdrop of higher inflation and energy prices, the outlook for euro area households has become gloomier, as reflected by a plunge in consumer confidence and expectations regarding their financial situation (Section 1.4). The squeeze on real incomes is expected to affect lower-income households disproportionately (Chart 6, panel a), as they often spend a larger proportion of their incomes on food and energy. Erosion of real disposable income and savings, together with higher interest rates, weakens households’ debt servicing capacity, particularly in countries where household debt levels are more elevated. Simulations of the impact of consumer price rises and interest rate changes on the near-term financial health of households reveal a more pronounced risk of default in lower income quintiles (Special Feature B), particularly for consumer credit. That said, there are a number of mitigants, including the small share of these households in overall household sector (especially mortgage) debt. Moreover, despite a weaker growth outlook, resilient labour markets have so far supported incomes, and the shift towards more fixed-rate mortgage lending in recent years shields many households from the immediate impact of higher interest rates. The use of macroprudential policies, notably borrower-based measures, in most euro area countries in recent years has also helped to limit excessive household borrowing.
Signs of a turn in the real estate cycle may compound the vulnerabilities of euro area household incomes and balance sheets. While moderating somewhat, euro area property markets still saw almost double-digit nominal price increases and sustained strong lending growth in the second quarter of 2022 (Section 1.5). However, households’ reported intentions to buy or build a home point to a turn in the real estate cycle, mirroring the sharp increase in interest rates on new mortgage loans since the start of 2022 (Chart 6, panel b). Also, providers of finance have become more cautious, as residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) have significantly underperformed the broader stock market and euro area banks have tightened their credit standards for mortgage loans (Chart 6, panel c). Overall, there are signs that the real estate expansion of recent years could come to an end, with overvaluation estimates and mortgage rates now standing at their highest levels in more than five years. Similarly, financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets have tightened, potentially reversing the post-pandemic recovery. According to survey data, a growing share of investors now see the market in the downturn phase of the cycle. A more pronounced correction in CRE markets could prompt investor losses, higher credit risk for lenders and a decline in collateral values.
Higher interest rates support bank profits, but worsening asset quality and higher funding costs pose headwinds
Rising interest rates have bolstered the short-term profitability outlook of euro area banks, which are becoming more active in hedging interest rate risk. Euro area bank profitability improved slightly in the first half of 2022, underpinned by lower operating expenses, still low loan loss provisions and higher operating income thanks to wider margins and stronger lending volumes (Chapter 3.2). Accordingly, bank analysts have also revised up their 2023 return on equity (ROE) forecasts for listed euro area banks to around 8%, as a higher interest rate environment bolsters their net interest income and, in turn, bank profitability (Chart 7, panel a). However, these expectations assume that future credit losses remain limited and are subject to downside risks. In terms of managing interest rate risk, euro area banks have become more active in the interest rate swaps market since early 2021. In particular, they have generally been net buyers of floating rate payments, hedging the risk from fixed-rate euro-denominated assets (Box 3).
A weaker economy and increased credit risk may weigh on bank profitability prospects in the medium term. Despite a significant worsening of the economic outlook, the asset quality of euro area banks showed no signs of broad-based deterioration in the first half of 2022, although recent trends in “underperforming” Stage 2 loans suggest some increase in credit risk. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, loans to energy-intensive firms have seen higher probabilities of default compared with less energy-intensive firms (Chapter 3.1). As interest rates rise, banks could also face higher credit risks stemming from their exposures to vulnerable sectors which have grown in recent years, notably including residential real estate markets. Banks’ cost of risk, defined as the ratio of loan impairments to loans, has fallen to pre-pandemic lows (Chart 7, panel b), but could rise going forward driven by both the need for higher loan loss provisions and the adverse denominator effect from likely lower loan volume growth as macroeconomic prospects deteriorate (Chapter 3.2).

Notes: Panel b: cost-of-risk data are available until Q2 2022 only. Cost of risk is defined as impairments on loans divided by loans. PMI stands for Purchasing Managers’ Index.
Higher market funding costs for banks make it more challenging to fund low-yielding assets. Bond funding costs have risen markedly for banks during 2022 – even surpassing pandemic highs across most instruments – driven by expectations of monetary policy normalisation, growing recession fears and deepening geopolitical tensions (Chart 7, panel c). While bank debt markets have remained open with no signs of fragmentation across euro area countries, banks with lower ratings and/or MREL shortfalls may need to issue new debt at much higher funding costs amid limited investor appetite. In addition, rising rates on new deposits, in particular in countries with a higher incidence of negative deposit rates, and maturing TLTRO III funds have started to translate into higher average funding costs for banks. Given the large shift over the last decade from floating to fixed-rate lending, higher funding costs may dampen some of the benefits for banks from higher interest rates.
Pre-existing structural weaknesses, together with a greater need to manage cyber risk, remain a challenge for banks looking ahead. Growing cyclical headwinds are compounded by longer-term challenges associated with low cost-efficiency, limited revenue diversification and remaining overcapacity in parts of the euro area banking sector. Accelerated digitalisation would help remedy some of these long-standing issues, although it comes at a cost of greater exposure to the threat of cyber risks (Special Feature C). However, heightened macro-financial uncertainty may delay the digital transformation plans of euro area banks, dampening their sustainable long-term profitability. In addition, euro area banks also need to manage the implications of the transition to a greener economy, including underlying concentration risks associated with climate-related exposures (Box 5).
Macroprudential policy enhances banks’ resilience, but the policy framework for non-banks must be strengthened
Prudential regulation and policy since the global financial crisis have helped put euro area banks in a good position to withstand the unfolding economic challenges. Despite several mitigating factors, accumulated macro-financial vulnerabilities have been compounded by the war in Ukraine, and the deteriorating economic outlook, inflationary pressures and tighter financing conditions are weighing on the debt servicing capacity of households and firms alike. At the same time, risks are more likely to materialise, given the possibility of further geopolitical and economic shocks. In this challenging environment, the substantial strengthening of bank balance sheets and capital positions over recent years has ensured that the sector is well-prepared to adapt to the potential materialisation of risks.
While considering headwinds to economic growth, macroprudential policy action can still help preserve and strengthen resilience across the financial system. Macroprudential policies, and in particular capital buffers consistent with the prevailing level of risk, help to ensure banks’ resilience and their ability to support the economy when systemic risk materialises. While activating buffers at an early stage has important benefits, increasing buffer rates can still be beneficial at the current, late stage of the financial cycle, provided that procyclical effects are avoided. Some countries with macro-financial imbalances may still increase macroprudential buffers, also considering that the existing capital headroom and remaining ability of many banks in the euro area to generate profits mitigate the risk of procyclical consequences (i.e. tighter lending conditions). Nevertheless, possible macroprudential policy responses need to take account of the highly volatile and uncertain course of the energy crisis in Europe and should be properly tailored to the specific conditions in each country. Irrespective of any macroprudential measures, banks themselves should ensure that their provisioning practices and capital planning properly account for the deteriorating risk environment and are aligned with supervisory expectations. Moreover, to enhance resilience over the medium term, the focus should remain on improving the effectiveness of the macroprudential toolkit and faithfully implementing Basel III.
Persistent vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector and recurring liquidity challenges make it important to expedite the policy response. While the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is currently assessing the effectiveness of its 2017 recommendations on liquidity mismatch in open-ended investment funds,
[

]
concrete policy proposals have already been developed for reforming money market funds (MMFs) globally.
[
2
]
In the light of the vulnerabilities that surfaced in March 2020 and the latent risk of renewed stress in the MMF sector, it is important that legislative reforms for MMFs be implemented in the EU without delay. The policy response on open-ended funds should aim to significantly reduce vulnerabilities arising from liquidity mismatch by better aligning redemption terms with asset liquidity (Chapter 5 and Box 6). Enhancing the availability and use of anti-dilution liquidity management tools should be part of the policy response, but this should not be seen as a substitute for more structural measures, such as minimum notice periods or requirements targeting asset liquidity. Another key priority for the international work should be to develop a globally consistent approach for addressing risk from leverage – including synthetic leverage – in the non-bank financial sector. In addition, recent volatility in financial markets and associated liquidity challenges have again emphasised the need to improve margining practices and NBFI preparedness to meet margin calls in derivatives transactions. Since agreeing and implementing such regulatory reforms internationally will take some time, NBFI supervisors should pay particularly close attention at this time to credit risk, liquidity risk and leverage in NBFIs, and take an active role in strengthening resilience within their mandate and existing regulatory frameworks.
Overall, financial stability conditions have deteriorated further in the euro area since the May 2022 FSR. Upside risks to inflation, especially from energy prices, and downside risks to growth have increased and are coupled with uncertainty around the precise path for monetary policy normalisation, less fiscal space, more volatile financial markets and multiple geopolitical risks. Together, these developments amplify the risk of disorderly adjustments in financial markets and pressures in NBFIs, as well as increasing debt sustainability concerns for more-indebted households, firms and governments. These vulnerabilities could materialise simultaneously and possibly reinforce each other, increasing the risks to euro area financial stability. In this challenging environment, targeted macroprudential policy can still support banks’ resilience, while risks in the non-bank financial sector should also be addressed from a systemic perspective.
1 Macro-financial and credit environment
1.1 Recession risks rise on energy prices and tighter financial conditions
Recession risks for the euro area have increased as energy prices have soared. Mounting pressure from gas supply disruptions, supply chain disruptions, elevated energy prices and weaker global trade are weighing heavily on economic activity. Private sector forecasters have downgraded their growth expectations for 2023 (-0.1% vs 2% in May 2022) while inflation expectations have increased further (5.8% vs 2.4% in May 2022, Chart 1.1, panel a). Moreover, inflation outturns have continued to overshoot consensus expectations, resulting in a global tightening of financial conditions (Overview). There are pronounced downside risks to central growth expectations, as reflected in an elevated probability of recession for all major western economies in the year ahead. Moreover, the pandemic continues to be a source of uncertainty, as the winter season might be accompanied by new containment measures. As a result, euro area economic growth-at-risk estimates for the year ahead are at highly elevated levels (-2.5%, Chart 1.1, panel b).

The severity of the energy crisis in the euro area has impacted the area’s terms of trade, weakening economic growth prospects. Although commodity prices have come down from their recent peaks, they remain elevated, particularly for natural gas and other energy commodities (Chart 1.2, panel a). As the euro area economy is a large net importer of energy, the euro area’s terms of trade have worsened in 2022. Maintaining import volumes at higher prices results in a transfer of purchasing power from the euro area to the rest of the world. This transfer has been more pronounced for euro area countries with more negative energy trade balances, because the composition of their exports does not allow such countries to benefit from positive terms of trade effects by exporting specific services, for instance (Chart 1.2, panel b). The negative income effect seems significantly larger in the euro area than in the United States and the United Kingdom, as these economies are less dependent on (net) energy imports.
[

]
This weaker trade position has also contributed to the sizeable depreciation of the euro’s exchange rate against its major global peers.

Globally, the fallout from the energy shock and the accompanying monetary policy normalisation has tightened financial conditions and increased risks for emerging market economies. The ongoing normalisation of accommodative domestic monetary policies amid a common inflation shock has led to a tightening of financial conditions and capital outflows for many emerging market economies (Chart 1.3, panel a). Sovereign spreads in emerging market economies have risen sharply, leaving the countries with a large share of foreign-owned or foreign currency-denominated debt vulnerable to a further tightening of financial conditions (Chart 1.3, panel b). Moreover, commodity-importing countries are under particular pressure from sustained high food and energy prices. As such, tail risks could materialise if there is a further deterioration in financial conditions or a prolonged period of high commodity prices.

Stress in the Chinese residential real estate sector has risen in recent months, increasing the downside risks to the global economy. This is reflected in a continued contraction in residential real estate sales. In addition, strict pandemic containment policies continue to depress economic activity, which is forecast to grow at around 4% per annum in the period 2022-23, significantly below the long-term average of 8%. Although the government’s interventions have largely contained the fallout from the real estate sector so far, the combination of strict zero-COVID policies and limited fiscal space could undermine its ability to manage future shocks. All in all, these developments add further downside risks to global economic prospects, with potentially significant spillovers to the euro area.
[

]
In sum, both the global and the euro area economy are facing a turbulent period, with risk stemming from tighter financial conditions, high indebtedness and soaring prices. Global economies are facing a historic inflation shock, while growth prospects have materially weakened and there are further pronounced downside risks to growth. High energy prices and tighter financial conditions are translating increasingly into financial market volatility, a weakening outlook for corporate earnings and a deteriorating fiscal outlook (Sections 1.2 and 1.3). Against this background, the risks stemming from exposing vulnerabilities to financial stability have increased since the previous issue of this review.
1.2 More constrained fiscal space available to cushion the economy
Fiscal positions have been weakened by the economic outlook, the impact of the war in Ukraine and a further tightening of financial conditions. The euro area budget balance is expected to improve steadily in the period to 2024, but by less than foreseen in May (Chart 1.4, panel a). The budget balance for this year is expected to be -3.8% of GDP (versus -3.1% forecast in May) and by 2024 is expected to be -2.7% of GDP (versus -2.3% forecast in May). Fiscal assumptions and projections are currently surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, given the elevated macroeconomic risks and the wider fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, it is estimated that the total fiscal stimulus related to reducing the impact of the war and the energy crisis on households and corporations will increase to at least 1.4% of GDP in 2022.
[
5
]
This sizeable stimulus follows pandemic-related support measures which were only just being wound up. Most of these measures are untargeted (Chart 1.4, panel b). Ideally, support measures should become more targeted and should aim to cushion the parts of the economy most affected by the current energy crisis.
Sovereign financing conditions have tightened significantly as credit risk premia have increased. Government bond yields have increased sharply since the previous issue of the Financial Stability Review, but so far government bond spreads have moved steadily in line with risk-free rates. Moreover, measures of sovereign stress – such as the ECB Sovereign Systemic Stress Composite Indicator – have shown a significant increase, but higher-debt countries have not been any more affected than other euro area countries. At the same time, debt servicing needs remain elevated, with some euro area countries facing refinancing and interest expenditure of around 40% of GDP over the next two years (Chapter 2).
[
6
]
Moreover, the increase in interest rates is weighing more heavily on fiscal positions than previously anticipated. As such, a further deterioration in financial conditions could change market sentiment towards some of the more vulnerable euro area sovereign issuers (Box 1).
Rollover risks are elevated but are currently being kept in check by several other structural factors. Although rollover risks have increased, sovereigns might be more resilient to deteriorating financial conditions than they were during the previous hiking cycle for a number of reasons. First, the lengthening of the maturity of the outstanding debt stock means that principal repayment needs are about 15% lower than they would have been for running the same amount of debt against the maturity profile in 2010.
[
7
]
Second, although yields have been increasing, the average interest paid on outstanding government debt for most euro area sovereigns is still hovering around record lows (1.6% in September 2022). Finally, the Transmission Protection Instrument partly reduces the risk of there being an unwarranted increase in risk premia.

*) See Bethuyne, G., Balcerowicz, W. and Erdei. M., “Budgetary policy measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on households and firms: methodology and budgetary impact”, European Commission, November 2022.
Despite the sizeable deficits, higher nominal GDP and a favourable snowball effect have helped to place government debt-to-GDP ratios on a declining trajectory. Euro area debt-to-GDP is projected to decline from 95.6% of GDP in 2021 to 89.9% in 2024, thereby remaining significantly above pre-pandemic levels (84%). The expected decline is driven mainly by expectations of a favourable interest rate-growth differential because of high nominal GDP growth, which should more than offset the persisting, albeit decreasing, primary deficits. Moreover, sovereign debt ratios have benefited from a declining real debt burden owing to first round effects (a favourable denominator effect, Chart 1.5, panel a)
[

]
. However, higher than expected inflation could contribute to deteriorating debt servicing capacity, even as inflation may reduce the real value of outstanding debt.
[
9
]
As such, risks to sovereign indebtedness are to the upside as a stagnating economy and higher-than-anticipated deficits might turn debt dynamics less favourable.

Panel b: the shock is calibrated to lead, in the absence of any monetary policy reaction, to a 1 percentage point increase in HICP inflation over three years. It is designed as a series of unexpected cost-push shocks originating in the rest of the world on their export of goods. This shock is analysed using the Euro Area and Global Economy (EAGLE) model, a multi-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model calibrated for the euro area’s four biggest countries, the rest of the euro area and the rest of the world. To limit the substitutability between goods imported from the rest of the world and euro area tradable goods, the elasticity has been lowered to take into account the high dependency of euro area countries on commodities imports. This calibrated parameter in EAGLE was lowered from 1.5 to 0.9 to reflect this dependency of euro area economies on some commodities imports.
*) Kezbere, L. and Maurer, H., “Deficit-debt adjustment (DDA) analysis: an analytical tool to assess the consistency of government finance statistics”, Statistics Paper Series, No 29, ECB, November 2018.
In a downside scenario, an inflationary supply shock originating from outside the euro area could prove particularly detrimental for public debt developments. An external supply shock could prove to be particularly unfavourable for public finances in the medium term. Simulations considering a stylised 1% inflationary supply shock show that the negative impact on economic activity might outweigh the positive impact of higher inflation on debt ratios (Chart 1.5, panel b). Despite the positive impact of inflation (indicated by a debt-reducing contribution of deflator growth), the decline in real growth, higher interest payments and a deteriorating cyclical budgetary component would contribute to a debt-to-GDP level that would be almost six percentage points higher over a ten-year horizon compared with the benchmark scenario. Although the currently observed shock is much more complex and involves additional demand components, its strong supply component may slow and, in some countries, even reverse the decline in sovereign debt ratios anticipated by the current benchmark scenario.
The fiscal space available to cushion the economy from an economic downturn is becoming more limited. Looking ahead, fiscal policy will be affected by both exposure to the war and the slowdown in economic activity. Moreover, a further inflationary shock driven by factors outside the euro area economy might be particularly bad for sovereign indebtedness, causing sovereigns to have less resilience to increasing debt service costs. For these reasons, the fiscal space available to cushion the economy from an economic downturn is becoming more constrained. Moreover, although the current support measures have helped to prevent tail risks from materialising during the COVID-19 pandemic, they would ideally be replaced by more targeted measures supporting those firms and households most impacted by the energy crisis. All in all, these adverse developments could trigger a reassessment of sovereign risk by market participants and reignite pressures on more vulnerable sovereigns (Box 1).

When financial fragmentation becomes a self-reinforcing dynamic, it can present a risk to financial stability.
[

As long as market functioning is orderly, credit spreads reflect macroeconomic fundamentals and risks. However, history has shown that spread-widening dynamics can become self-reinforcing. In the euro area, such adverse market dynamics have often been termed “fragmentation”. This is often associated with impaired market liquidity conditions, ultimately resulting in impaired market functioning. In such conditions spread differences may start to diverge from fundamentals. However, differences in spreads alone do not necessarily point to fragmentation (Figure A).

1.3 Corporate resilience tested by energy price and borrowing costs
Following the sharp recovery and high profits seen over the past year, euro area corporates now face stagnating activity and tightening financial conditions. Backward-looking measures of aggregate corporate vulnerabilities have remained below their long-run average, with surprisingly strong gross profits (8% above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2022). Additionally, public support measures implemented by governments have helped to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, despite the overall tightening of financial conditions, lower indebtedness and a high interest coverage ratio are keeping corporate vulnerabilities below their long-term average (Chart 1.6, panel a). However, corporates are facing new challenges and corporate vulnerabilities are expected to increase above their long-run average over the coming quarters because of a worsening interest coverage ratio, higher financing costs, fading activity and higher leverage. Moreover, small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) have benefited less from the rebound in economic activity, as survey indicators suggest that their profitability is still lagging that of large corporations (Chart 1.6, panel b). These firms might be at a higher risk of insolvency if economic activity surprises to the downside and financial conditions tighten further.

The sharp increase in energy prices may challenge certain business models and may negatively impact the competitiveness of euro area firms. Business confidence has started to decline in those sectors that are most energy intensive (Chart 1.7, panel a). At the same time, the ECB’s bank lending survey and hard data on bank loans show that loan demand has increased strongly for short maturities, reflecting the increased need for firms to cover higher production costs (Chart 1.7, panel b).
[
13
]
This is also reflected by the larger increase in leverage for sectors with a high exposure to commodities (Chart 1.7, panel c). Going forward, it might become difficult to sustain high output prices as economic activity stagnates while supply pressures remain. Moreover, as the euro area is a large net importer of energy, the current energy price shock – and in particular higher gas prices in the euro area – is negatively impacting the competitiveness of euro area firms. Producers therefore might have less pricing power than their international competitors to pass on higher costs and input prices to end users (Section 1.1). This has put some corporates in a vulnerable position, particularly those with elevated debt service needs, high energy use and fixed contractual obligations.

Tighter financing conditions have impacted firms’ debt servicing costs and might increase credit risk for more vulnerable firms. Corporate financing conditions have deteriorated as monetary policy has normalised and both markets and banks have reassessed the risks surrounding corporate activity (Chapter 2). Moreover, the shift from bank loans towards market-based funding seen since the financial crisis is currently helping to ensure that tightening financing conditions are having a more direct impact on corporate debt service ratios than was the case a decade ago.
[

As a result, the cost of debt has increased sharply in recent months.
[

Banks are also anticipating a further net tightening of credit standards in the future, reflecting the uncertain economic outlook (Chapter 3). This may be particularly concerning for the cohort of firms that exited the pandemic with higher debt levels, subdued earnings and lower liquidity buffers. At the same time, corporate balance sheets in most euro area countries are currently healthier than they were during previous rate hiking cycles. Gross debt and interest coverage ratios have improved, in particular for countries which started with higher debt levels in the non-financial corporate sector (Chart 1.8, panel a). Non-financial corporate debt levels declined to 150% of gross value added (GVA) in the second quarter of 2022 but remain above the 148% of GVA recorded before the pandemic.

Insolvencies have remained well below their pre-pandemic levels, although they have increased in some economic sectors. Insolvencies remained below their long-term average in the second quarter of 2022 (Chart 1.8, panel b). At the same time, insolvencies in those sectors most heavily impacted by the pandemic remain above their long-run average. Moreover, forward-looking measures for insolvencies signal elevated insolvency risk for those sectors impacted by the current energy crisis, such as transport and industry. As such, insolvencies could rise in those sectors most affected by the current energy crisis and have not yet fully recovered from the impact of the pandemic.
All in all, corporate vulnerabilities have increased given that financial conditions are tightening, the cost of doing business remains high and economic activity is stagnating. Structural factors might mean the average corporate is in better health than it was during previous hiking cycles, providing corporates with some resilience to weather the current tightening of financial conditions. However, the uneven impact along the cross-section of firms during both the pandemic and the current energy crisis might imply that an economic recession could have more severe consequences for financial stability than this aggregate picture suggests. As such, defaults could increase going forward, with potential knock-on effects on bank balance sheets and household employment prospects.
1.4 Household vulnerabilities, previously contained, are rising
High inflation and fears of recession are clouding euro area households’ economic outlook. As households are increasingly worried about their future amid rising living costs and concerns over an economic downturn, consumer confidence and households’ expectations of their future financial situation have reached new historical lows (Chart 1.9, panel a). While buoyant labour markets, with a historically low unemployment rate of 6.6% in September 2022, have so far supported household incomes, inflation is continuing to squeeze their real disposable incomes. Higher spending on non-durables such as food and gas have shaped the rebound in consumer expenditures, but this mostly reflects higher prices (Chart 1.9, panel b). As the high savings rate seen during the pandemic normalises, households’ ability to cushion further price increases is gradually decreasing. Due to downturns in financial markets, households’ net worth has started to decline, standing at 750% of disposable income in the second quarter of 2022, down over 25 percentage points in the first half of the year.

Consumer sentiment is falling further amid continued high inflation, despite labour market strength supporting households

Notes: Panel a: the latest data for the unemployment rate refer to September 2022.
Household borrowing has remained robust, although there are increasing signs it has reached a turning point. Household indebtedness has remained broadly stable, decreasing slightly to just under 97% of disposable income in the second quarter of 2022, although the figures vary greatly across countries. So far, credit provision to households has held up. Growth in lending for house purchase as well as consumption has remained stable in recent months, with September showing growth of 5.1% and 3.7% respectively, but the upward trend appears to have come to a halt (Chart 1.10, panel a). However, with interest rates on household credit having increased sharply in the wake of monetary policy normalisation and banks reporting a tightening of credit standards as well as a reduction in loan demand from households, a further moderation of lending volumes is likely.
Chart 1.10
Households’ indebtedness remains stable while interest rates have increased sharply
Sources: ECB (MFI Interest Rate Statistics, MFI Balance Sheet Items), Eurostat (Quarterly Sector Accounts) and ECB calculations.
Notes: Panel a: the latest data for the gross debt-to-income ratio refer to the second quarter of 2022. Panel b shows the share of new credit flows with initial interest rate fixation for more than five years of new lending to households for house purchase, consumption and other purposes, including renegotiations. The cost of borrowing is the average of interest rates on new lending to households for house purchase, consumption and other purposes, weighted by new lending volumes.
As interest rates rise, some households’ debt servicing capacity may suffer. In the low interest rate environment of the last decade, the share of new loans with interest rate fixation periods of more than five years has increased steadily in many countries, reaching almost 70% across the euro area in the first half of 2022. This has shielded many households from having their existing debt repriced at higher interest rates in the short term. However, following the sharp increase in interest rates the share of new loans with longer interest rate fixation periods has started to decline in a number of countries (Chart 1.10, panel b). Households may therefore become more exposed to interest rate risks in the medium term. As a further tightening of credit standards is expected, a cohort of households at the lower end of the income distribution – who may have high individual indebtedness, but overall account for a low share of aggregate debt – and a cohort of those that used low interest rates to exhaust their borrowing capacity may be at risk of falling into distress (Special Feature B).
Overall, vulnerabilities among households have increased further, although there are some resilience factors. While excess savings have been re-absorbed by inflation and net wealth has started to decline, the aggregate household balance sheet remains resilient and households are benefiting from the current strength of labour markets. At the same time, rising inflation is weighing on households’ real incomes and consumption, which could slow the economy’s growth path. Some households may have to limit consumption or become dependent on government support. Such vulnerabilities could worsen should labour market conditions deteriorate. The immediate effect of the rapid increase in interest rates on households’ debt servicing capacity is being mitigated by the longer interest rate fixation periods which have benefited many households in recent years. In the medium term, vulnerabilities could be exposed and debt servicing capacity could deteriorate, especially in countries where residential properties are overvalued, debt levels are elevated and household debt is prevalently at variable interest rates.
1.5 Vulnerable real estate markets may be at a turning point
Euro area residential real estate (RRE) markets have shown strong price and lending growth, but forward-looking indicators suggest a slowdown. Nominal house prices grew 9.3% at the euro area aggregate level in the second quarter of 2022 – a slightly lower rate than in the previous quarter (Chart 1.11, panel a). This strong growth led to increasingly stretched valuations in some euro area countries as house price dynamics exceeded the fundamentals. The stock of housing loans has continued to show stable growth, but the record steep increase in borrowing costs since the beginning of 2022 and the expected further tightening of financial conditions are likely to reduce demand for new loans going forward (Chart 1.11, panel b). Euro area households have also declared they are less likely to buy or build a home whilst a lower share of construction companies expect construction prices to increase and the residential construction PMI reflects a weakening of activity in this sector. As demand slows, the construction sector could come under pressure, potentially resulting in rising defaults and declining investment. Monthly data indicate that in some national RRE markets prices have been falling month-on-month since late summer.

RRE prices and lending have continued to show strong growth but forward-looking indicators point to a moderation in RRE prices

Notes: Panel a: the latest observation for RRE price growth is for the second quarter of 2022. Panel b: expected credit standards and demand refer to loans for house purchase. Intention to buy a house and construction companies’ price expectations are shown in standard deviations from long-term averages. Residential construction PMI is shown in standard deviations from 50, the level which demarcates expansionary (above 50) and contractionary (below 50) territory.
Higher interest rates will increase households’ debt servicing costs, with the speed of impact differing according to mortgage type. Between the beginning of the year and September 2022, interest rates on mortgage loans increased by over 110 basis points at the euro area level. Simulations using loan-level data from securitised mortgage loans from the end of 2021 show that an increase in interest rates of 200 basis points would lead to an increa"

Compared with August:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months ahead increased slightly, while expectations for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months declined markedly, while expectations for nominal spending growth remained unchanged;
expectations declined significantly for economic growth over the next 12 months and increased for unemployment in 12 months’ time;
consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to remain unchanged, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to rise, with the median rate now standing at 8.1%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months increased from 5.0% to 5.1%, while expectations for inflation three years ahead were unchanged at 3.0%. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead edged down in September but remained well above the level that prevailed before the start of the war in Ukraine. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, while younger respondents (18-34 years) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (55-70 years). (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 0.6% over the next 12 months, down from 1.0% in August. The decline was strongest for older respondents (55-70 years) and households with income around or just below the median. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months edged down to 5.7%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months remained unchanged at 4.5%. Consumers’ expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups, while younger respondents (18-34 years) continued to report lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined significantly from -1.7% in August to -2.4%. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead rose to 12.2%, from 11.9% in August. Consumers continued to expect the unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.5%). Expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead were quite well aligned across age groups but were again higher for lower-income respondents (first income quintile) than for higher-income respondents (fifth income quintile), by 3.3 percentage points. (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. Consumers expected the growth in the price of their homes over the next 12 months to remain at 3.4%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.5%, 1.2 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. While consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months tightened again, their expectations of access to credit over the next 12 months eased slightly.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-June 2022, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector and comprise a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-June 2022 data refer to 316 banking groups and 2440 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s implementing technical standards on supervisory reporting, while some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.

Tighter credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties, mainly attributed to deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning
Higher maximum amount of funding but shorter maximum maturity against domestic government bonds
Deterioration in liquidity conditions continued for most collateral types
Higher initial margin requirements for most OTC derivative types, especially commodity derivatives
On balance, overall credit terms and conditions tightened over the June-August 2022 review period across all counterparty types. Price terms tightened for all counterparty types, but in particular for banks and dealers, investment funds and hedge funds. Non-price terms tightened for hedge funds and banks and dealers. The overall tightening of credit terms and conditions ? mainly attributed to a deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning ? continued the trend reported for the previous five quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the June 2022 survey. Overall credit terms are expected to tighten further over the September-November 2022 review period. The amount of resources dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures increased in the June-August 2022 review period, while the use of financial leverage and the availability of unutilised leverage decreased.
In the case of securities financing transactions, the maximum amount of funding offered against collateral in the form of euro-denominated domestic government bonds increased, while the maximum maturity offered decreased. For other types of collateral, respondents reported a mixed picture. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral either increased or remained unchanged, while financing rates/spreads increased for financing secured against all collateral types. The liquidity of most collateral types continued to deteriorate, with the largest percentage of respondents reporting a decrease in the liquidity of high-yield corporate bonds.
Turning to non-centrally cleared over-the counter (OTC) derivatives, initial margin requirements for most OTC derivatives, and especially commodity derivatives, increased during the June-August 2022 review period. While liquidity and trading deteriorated somewhat for credit derivatives referencing corporates or structured credit products as well as commodity derivatives and total return swaps, they remained unchanged for all other OTC derivative types. Respondents also reported an increase in the volume, duration and persistence of valuation disputes for OTC commodity derivatives contracts.
The September 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The September 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between June 2022 and August 2022. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 27 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 13 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Croatia introducing the euro means Croatian banks subject to minimum reserve requirements
Integrating Croatian institutions smoothly into Eurosystem’s minimum reserve system necessitates transitional provisions
On 20 October 2022 the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a Decision on the application of minimum reserves by the ECB following the introduction of the euro in Croatia on 1 January 2023 (ECB/2022/36).
As of 1 January 2023, credit institutions and branches of credit institutions (hereafter referred to as “institutions”) located in Croatia will be subject to the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve requirements. Given that the regular reserve maintenance period runs from 21 December 2022 to 7 February 2023, transitional provisions are necessary to ensure that the relevant institutions are integrated smoothly into the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve system, without placing a disproportionate burden on institutions located in Croatia.
The Decision, in line with decisions taken when other countries joined the euro area, provides for a transitional maintenance period from 1 January to 7 February 2023 for the imposition of minimum reserve requirements on institutions located in Croatia. Furthermore, the Decision sets out specific rules governing the application of minimum reserve requirements during the transitional period and describes the method for calculating the reserve base in relation to the transitional period for liabilities owed to institutions located in Croatia. In this respect, institutions located in other euro area countries may decide to deduct any liabilities owed to institutions located in Croatia from their reserve base for the maintenance periods from 21 December 2022 to 7 February 2023 and from 8 February to 21 March 2023.
The Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

HICP inflation expectations revised up further for 2022-2024 horizons, but unchanged for the longer term
Real GDP growth expectations revised down
Unemployment rate expectations revised up
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2022, respondents revised up further their inflation expectations for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 horizons. These now stand at 8.3%, 5.8% and 2.4% respectively; 1.0, 1.2 and 0.3 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. According to respondents, the upward revisions primarily reflect a combination of higher (non-oil) energy and food prices as well as their pass-through to other prices and higher forecast wage growth. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) stood unchanged at 2.2% on average.
GDP growth expectations were revised down substantially for 2023. Respondents now expect activity to broadly stagnate in 2023 (0.1% growth) and expect growth to be negative between the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 with a cumulative decline of 0.7%. This is attributed to ongoing high energy price pressures, inflation affecting households’ purchasing power, a weaker global economy and tighter monetary policy. Longer-term growth expectations were revised down marginally to 1.4%.
Unemployment rate expectations were revised up for all horizons by between 0.1 and 0.4 percentage points. The profile for the future unemployment rate is hump-shaped with an increase to 7.1% expected in 2023 and a gradual decline thereafter to 6.6% by 2027."
,"Summary
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2022, HICP inflation expectations were revised up further for the 2022-2024 horizons, standing at 8.3%, 5.8% and 2.4% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.

]
According to respondents, the upward revisions primarily reflect a combination of higher (non-oil) energy and food prices as well as their pass-through into other prices. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were unchanged at 2.2%. Expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised up for the period 2022-2024. According to respondents, these revisions mainly reflect ongoing stronger and broader indirect effects as well as higher forecast wage growth. GDP growth expectations were revised down substantially for 2023. Respondents now expect a broad stagnation of economic activity in 2023 (0.1% growth), and three quarters of negative growth between the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, with a cumulative decline of 0.7%. Longer-term growth expectations were revised down marginally to 1.4%. The profile of the expected unemployment rate was revised up for all horizons by between 0.1-0.4 percentage points. The expected profile for the future unemployment rate is hump-shaped, increasing to 7.1% in 2023 and gradually declining thereafter to 6.6% by 2027.

1 HICP inflation expectations revised up further for 2022, 2023 and 2024
SPF respondents revised up further their inflation expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024. These stand at 8.3%, 5.8% and 2.4% respectively; 1.0, 2.2 and 0.3 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round (see Chart 1). Compared with the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, inflation expectations in this SPF round were higher by 0.2 percentage points for 2022, by 0.3 percentage points for 2023 and by 0.1 percentage point for 2024 (see Table 1).
Chart 1
Inflation expectations: overall HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco
(annual percentage changes)
Respondents considered current inflation to be largely driven by supply-side factors, with energy and food prices cited as the main factors behind upward revisions to the 2022 and 2023 inflation forecasts. In addition to their direct impact on consumer prices, respondents also noted that indirect effects working through the pricing chain, together with higher expected wage growth as well as the weaker euro (against the dollar) were the factors behind the higher forecasts for HICP inflation excluding food and energy. While respondents reported that these factors were stronger than previously expected, they thought that underlying demand pressures on inflation would be more moderate, reflecting lower expected economic activity.
For the shorter- and medium-term horizons, uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook increased again to record levels.
[

]
Quantitative indicators of uncertainty for inflation derived from the reported probability distributions increased further from the already historically high levels in the previous round. The high level of “aggregate uncertainty” is owing to unprecedented “disagreement” among forecasters about their point forecasts combined with a high average level of “individual uncertainty”. Disagreement about two-year-ahead inflation expectations (measured by the standard deviation of point expectations) stood at 1.25 percentage points, which is five times the historical average since 1999. The aggregate probability distributions for the calendar years from 2022 to 2024 are presented in Chart 2. The quantitative balance of risk indicator (calculated as the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution minus the average reported point expectation) for the two-year-ahead horizon eased back. However, this movement must be interpreted with caution as the weight associated with outcomes in the open-ended interval (i.e. inflation being 5% or higher) increased to 6.8% from 1.4% in the previous round.

]
In their qualitative remarks, respondents noted that the main risks related to energy prices and their pass-through, the conflict in Ukraine and possible wage developments. For energy prices, downside as well as upside risks were mentioned, but the latter predominated. Wage developments were generally considered an upward risk. Some respondents spoke of weaker economic activity as a possible downside risk factor.
SPF expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised up for the 2022-2024 horizons. HICPX expectations stood at 4.0%, 3.9% and 2.6% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively, representing upward revisions of 0.4 percentage points for 2022, 1.0 percentage point for 2023 and 0.3 percentage points for 2024. Similar to the previous round, respondents again indicated that the upward revisions reflect a more intense and broader pass-through from higher energy and food prices. They also considered that higher wage increases would play a role. The SPF forecasts for HICPX were higher than those from the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for 2022, 2023 and 2024 by 0.1, 0.5 and 0.3 percentage points respectively (see Table 1).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This Chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in 2022, 2023 and 2024. To minimise the number of bins in the questionnaire, the upper bin for inflation outcomes was set to ? 5.0%. The fact that this would lead to most probability being assigned to the upper bin for some horizons was flagged to respondents when sending out the questionnaire. *The highest bin used in the second quarter of 2022 rounds was ?4.0%.
2 Longer-term inflation expectations remained unchanged
Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were unchanged at 2.2%. With a trimmed mean, where the highest response and the two lowest responses are removed, in both the current and previous rounds, the average would be unchanged at 2.1%. The median (and modal) point expectation was unchanged at 2.0%. The estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution was unchanged at 2.2% (see Chart 3). In the most recent round (fourth quarter of 2022), considering a balanced panel of 38 respondents who also replied in the previous round, nine respondents revised their longer-term inflation expectations downwards and nine revised their expectations upwards, while 20 respondents reported unchanged longer-term inflation expectations. The average expectation of this balanced panel was also unchanged at 2.2%. The distribution of individual point forecasts was broadly unchanged in this round (see Chart 4). Similar to the previous two rounds, there was again a number of respondents who reported longer-term inflation expectations at or above 2.5% (7, or 16%, in the fourth quarter of 2022 round compared with 8, or 17%, in the third quarter of 2022 round).

Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in the third and fourth quarter of 2022 rounds and to 2026 in the second quarter of 2022 round.
Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations again increased sharply, and the balance of risks remained broadly balanced. The increase in “aggregate uncertainty” – the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution (see Chart 5) – was primarily owing to increased “individual uncertainty”, as measured by the average width of the individual probability distributions, while “disagreement” edged back slightly from the historically high level in the previous round. The balance of risk indicator remained close to zero (i.e. balanced). The probability associated with longer-term inflation being in the 1.5-2.5% range remained broadly unchanged at 46%, with a 33% probability above this range (i.e. >2.5%) and a 20% probability below this range (i.e. <1.5%).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This Chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in the longer term. *The highest bin used in the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2022 rounds was ?4.0. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in the third quarter of 2022 round and to 2026 in the previous rounds shown.
The longer-term expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) decreased to 2.1% from 2.2% in the previous round. Respondents mentioned lower demand and economic activity as factors influencing their inflation expectations. Thus, the substantial downward revision to the expected profile of economic activity (see Chart 8) may be behind the downward revision to longer-term HICPX. The median longer-term point expectation for HICPX also decreased to 1.9% from 2.0%, while the modal (most frequent) response remained 2.0%. While 30% of participants reported 2.0%, 50% reported 1.9% or lower and 20% reported 2.1% or higher. Of the 27 respondents who provided longer-term HICPX expectations in both the fourth quarter of 2022 and third quarter of 2022 rounds, eight revised them down, 15 were unchanged and four revised them up. While the evolution of longer-term expectations for HICP and HICPX inflation had been broadly similar for the period of available data since the fourth quarter of 2016 up to the second quarter of 2022 (with a level difference of around 0.1 percentage point on average), the evolution in the most recent two rounds has been somewhat different (with the sharp increase in HICPX in the third quarter of 2022 being reverted this round).
3 Real GDP growth expectations revised down
GDP growth expectations in the fourth quarter of 2022 survey round stood at 3.0% for 2022, 0.1% for 2023 and 1.6% for 2024 (see Chart 6). Compared with the previous round, these imply an upward revision of 0.2 percentage points for 2022, but downward revisions of 1.4 percentage points for 2023 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024. The upward revision to the 2022 annual growth rate expectation reflected the stronger than expected outcomes in the first two quarters of 2022, the impact of which outweighed the downward revisions for the third and fourth quarters of 2022. Respondents expected economic activity to contract in the second half of 2022 and in early 2023. This was attributed to ongoing high energy price pressures, inflation harming households’ purchasing power, a weaker global economy and a more restrictive monetary policy. High uncertainty regarding possible energy supply shortages was considered to have a strong negative impact on the outlook. Nonetheless, some respondents noted that fiscal responses are building up and may partly mitigate the loss in purchasing power. They also expected that the weaker euro would stimulate exports, partly offsetting the weaker global demand. Risks were viewed as largely negative and dominated by the danger of energy shortages and the possibility of rationing policies. A harsher winter may add to these. Whether or not Europe can find alternative suppliers and reduce consumption was seen as crucial. In addition, respondents remarked that a fast monetary policy tightening could worsen financial conditions and global demand, notably through a potential US recession. Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic risks and supply chain disruptions, although still present, were less prominent in respondents’ qualitative comments. New virus waves were still reported as a threat to the service sector, but also to global supply chains via China, where policy space was considered to be limited and to not allow for a strong reaction. Downward risks related to the war in Ukraine were seen to remain. Longer-term growth expectations (which refer to 2027) were marginally lower at 1.4%, down by 0.1 percentage point.

Respondents were again asked to provide the profile of their short-term GDP outlook (from the third quarter of 2022 until the second quarter of 2023).

]
Actual quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for the second quarter of 2022 was 0.8%, substantially more than the forecast of 0.2% in the previous SPF. In this round, forecasters expected quarter-on-quarter growth to fall into negative territory, at around -0.1% on average between the third quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023 (ranging from -0.4% to 0.2%). This is about 0.5 percentage points lower per quarter from the third quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023 than forecast in the previous round (see Chart 7). Almost all forecasters who provided a forecast quarterly growth profile expected at least one quarter of negative growth between the third quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023 (mostly for the fourth quarter of 2022 and for the first quarter of 2023), and 86% of these respondents forecast a so-called “technical recession” – two consecutive quarters of negative growth – over the period. Compared with the September 2022 macroeconomic projection exercise, SPF expectations were more pessimistic for all four quarters (by about 0.3 percentage points per quarter on average).

Expected profile of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth
(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes)
Notes: Grey area indicates one standard deviation (of individual expectations) around average SPF expectation.
Although real GDP returned to above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2021, the strong downward revision to expected growth in 2023 have again delayed its expected return to the pre-pandemic profile (see Chart 8). Compared with the profile expected in the first quarter of 2022 round (conducted in early January, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) where it was expected to overtake the pre-pandemic trend during the course of 2023, the level profile of GDP has been revised down (by about 4% in 2026). Expected GDP levels are also lower than forecast in the September macroeconomic projection exercise (by about 1% in 2024).

(2019 = 100)
Note: Growth expectations for years not surveyed have been interpolated linearly.
Quantitative measures of uncertainty moderated this round and the two-year-ahead balance of risks remained strongly negative (see Chart 9 and Chart 10). Aggregate uncertainty decreased both at the two-year-ahead and longer-term horizons, although remaining above levels which prevailed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The balance of risks improved for the two-year-ahead horizon, but it remained strongly on the downside.

This Chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of real GDP growth outcomes in the longer term. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 rounds and to 2026 in the second quarter of 2022 round.
4 Unemployment rate expectations broadly revised up
The average point forecasts for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2022 round were 6.8%, 7.1% and 7.0% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. These were revised upwards from the previous round by 0.1 percentage point for 2022 and 0.4 percentage points for 2023 and 2024. The expectation for 2027 was 6.6%, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage points but still close to the historical lows observed for the long-term unemployment expectations. The unemployment rate is expected to increase until 2023 and then follow a downward sloping trajectory – steeper than in the previous round, although hovering at higher levels (see Chart 11). The upward revisions to unemployment expectations are the first since the third quarter of 2020 round. Respondents reported the same factors as for lower growth expectations – for example, high energy inflation, weaker domestic and international demand – as the reasons for an upward revision of short- and medium-term unemployment expectations. Upside risks were perceived in a further slowdown of economic activity. By contrast, demographic factors and labour shortages in certain sectors were frequently mentioned as downside risks.
Chart 11
Expectations for the unemployment rate
(percentages of the labour force)
Uncertainty around expectations for the unemployment rate increased slightly for all horizons, remaining at relatively high levels, and the balance of risks was broadly neutral for all horizons. On balance, the distributions continued losing the somewhat positive skewness of previous rounds and are now showing a greater degree of symmetry for all horizons (see Chart 12 and Chart 13). The balance of risk indicator for longer-term expectations remained positive, as the mean of the aggregated probability distribution (at 6.7%) was slightly higher than the average point forecast (6.6%).

Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in the third and fourth quarter of 2022 rounds and to 2026 in the second quarter of 2022 round shown.
5 Expectations for other variables
Forecasters expected: the ECB’s key main refinancing operations (MRO) interest rate to increase steadily from 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 2.6% in the first quarter of 2023 and stabilise at around an average of 2.7% until 2024; the euro to marginally appreciate against the dollar from 0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 1.05 in 2024; oil prices to progressively decrease to levels around USD 85 per barrel until 2024; and nominal wage growth to increase at a rate higher than 4% until 2023 but to moderate to below 3% in the long-term.
The median (and majority) expectation, based on approximately 50 replies, was for the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to increase steadily from 2.0% in the fourth quarter 2022 to 2.9% in the third quarter of 2023. Interest rates are expected to fluctuate around an average level of 2.7% between 2023 (up from 1.5%) and 2024 (up from 1.8%) (see Chart 14a). Concerning the 2023 average, 36% of the replies reported values below 2.5% (down from 98%). Similarly, 18% (down from 83%) of respondents expected interest rates to be, on average, below 2% in 2024 and about 58% (up from 5%) to be above 2.5%.
The expected average USD/EUR exchange rate was revised downward over all horizons and it is expected to stand at around 1.02 in 2023, to then marginally increase up to 1.05 by 2024 (see Chart 14b).
Compared with the previous round, the level of US dollar-denominated oil prices (per barrel) was revised downwards. The revisions were about USD 8 and USD 5 per barrel for 2023 and 2024, respectively. This resulted in a flatter downward trajectory from about USD 95 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2022 to around USD 85 per barrel in 2024 (see Chart 14c). Notwithstanding the weaker expected USD/EUR exchange rate, the implied revisions to the profile for the oil price in euro terms are lower than those in US dollar terms – EUR 1.9 in 2023 and EUR 0.8 in 2024.
Expectations for the annual growth in compensation per employee were revised up by 0.2-0.5 percentage points over all horizons up to 2024 (see Chart 14d). At 2.2 percentage points, the combined revisions in the past two rounds to the next and year after next calendar year horizons have been the largest since this question was first asked in 2004. However, expectations for 2027 were recorded to stand at about 2.9%, essentially unchanged from the previous round.

ECB recalibrates third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) to ensure consistency with broader monetary policy normalisation process
Recalibration will help address unexpected and extraordinary inflation increases by reinforcing transmission of policy rates to bank lending conditions
From 23 November 2022, interest rate on all remaining TLTRO III operations to be indexed to average applicable key ECB interest rates from that date onward
Existing interest rate calculation maintained for period up to 22 November 2022
Modification accompanied by three additional voluntary early repayment dates introduced for banks wishing to terminate or reduce borrowings before maturity
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) as part of the monetary policy measures adopted to restore price stability over the medium term. In view of the current inflationary developments and outlook, it is necessary to adapt certain parameters of TLTRO III to reinforce the transmission of our policy rates to bank lending conditions so that TLTRO III contributes to the transmission of the monetary policy stance needed to ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.
The recalibration of the TLTRO III terms and conditions will contribute to the normalisation of bank funding costs. The ensuing normalisation of financing conditions, in turn, will exert downward pressure on inflation, contributing to restoring price stability over the medium term. The recalibration also removes deterrents to early voluntary repayment of outstanding TLTRO III funds. Earlier voluntary repayments would reduce the Eurosystem balance sheet and, with that, contribute to the overall monetary policy normalisation.
From 23 November 2022 until the maturity date or early repayment date of each respective outstanding TLTRO III operation, the interest rate on TLTRO III operations will be indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates over this period.
The existing interest rate calculation method will be maintained for the period from the settlement date of each respective TLTRO III operation until 22 November 2022, albeit with indexing to the applicable key ECB interest rates ending on that date.
Furthermore, three additional voluntary early repayment dates will be introduced to provide TLTRO III participants with additional opportunities to partly, or fully, repay their respective TLTRO III borrowings before their maturity.
The first additional voluntary repayment opportunity will coincide with the start of the new interest rate calculation method on 23 November 2022. Counterparties will need to inform their respective national central bank by 16 November 2022 of their intention to use this repayment option. The repayment calendar will be updated on the ECB’s website accordingly.
These changes to the terms and conditions of TLTRO III will apply to all TLTRO III operations still outstanding and will be implemented via a sixth amendment to the Decision of the ECB of 22 July 2019 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/2019/21), as amended by the Decisions of the ECB of 12 September 2019 (ECB/2019/28), 16 March 2020 (ECB/2020/13), 30 April 2020 (ECB/2020/25), 29 January 2021 (ECB/2021/3) and 30 April 2021 (ECB/2021/21). The amendment will shortly be published on the ECB’s website and subsequently in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises at the 2% medium-term target.

Notes
The ECB announced TLTRO III on 7 March 2019 and published further details on 6 June 2019. It announced changes to TLTRO III on 12 September 2019, an easing of the conditions on 12 March 2020, a recalibration on 30 April 2020 and an extension of support for banks on 10 December 2020.

,"27 October 2022
The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. With this third major policy rate increase in a row, the Governing Council has made substantial progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation. The Governing Council took today’s decision, and expects to raise interest rates further, to ensure the timely return of inflation to its 2% medium-term inflation target. The Governing Council will base the future policy rate path on the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy, following its meeting-by-meeting approach.
Inflation remains far too high and will stay above the target for an extended period. In September, euro area inflation reached 9.9%. In recent months, soaring energy and food prices, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand have led to a broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation. The Governing Council’s monetary policy is aimed at reducing support for demand and guarding against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.
The Governing Council also decided to change the terms and conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). During the acute phase of the pandemic, this instrument played a key role in countering downside risks to price stability. Today, in view of the unexpected and extraordinary rise in inflation, it needs to be recalibrated to ensure that it is consistent with the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of policy rate increases to bank lending conditions. The Governing Council therefore decided to adjust the interest rates applicable to TLTRO III from 23 November 2022 and to offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates.
Finally, in order to align the remuneration of minimum reserves held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem more closely with money market conditions, the Governing Council decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the ECB’s deposit facility rate.
The details of the changes to the TLTRO III terms and conditions are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET. Another technical press release, detailing the change to the remuneration of minimum reserves, will also be published at 15:45 CET.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 2.00%, 2.25% and 1.50% respectively, with effect from 2 November 2022.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council decided to adjust the interest rates applicable to TLTRO III. From 23 November 2022 until the maturity date or early repayment date of each respective outstanding TLTRO III operation, the interest rate on TLTRO III operations will be indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates over this period. The Governing Council also decided to offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates. In any case, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

Minimum reserves to be remunerated at deposit facility rate
Change better aligns minimum reserves remuneration with money market rates
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate (DFR). The change will become effective as of the beginning of the reserve maintenance period starting on 21 December 2022.
Minimum reserves are the average funds that credit institutions are required to hold in their reserve accounts at their national central bank over a maintenance period.
These have until now been remunerated at the ECB’s main refinancing operations (MRO) rate. However, under the prevailing market and liquidity conditions, the DFR better reflects the rate at which funds can be invested in money market instruments if not held as minimum reserves and the rate at which banks borrow funds in the money market to fulfil minimum reserves.
For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.
Notes
The ECB has published explanations of minimum reserves and the deposit facility rate.
Further information on minimum reserves can be found in Regulation (EU) 2021/378 of the European Central Bank of 22 January 2021 on the application of minimum reserve requirements (ECB/2021/1), (OJ L 73, 3.3.2021, p. 1–15)."

Minimum reserves to be remunerated at deposit facility rate
Change better aligns minimum reserves remuneration with money market rates
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate (DFR). The change will become effective as of the beginning of the reserve maintenance period starting on 21 December 2022.
Minimum reserves are the average funds that credit institutions are required to hold in their reserve accounts at their national central bank over a maintenance period.
These have until now been remunerated at the ECB’s main refinancing operations (MRO) rate. However, under the prevailing market and liquidity conditions, the DFR better reflects the rate at which funds can be invested in money market instruments if not held as minimum reserves and the rate at which banks borrow funds in the money market to fulfil minimum reserves.

Notes
The ECB has published explanations of minimum reserves and the deposit facility rate.
Further information on minimum reserves can be found in Regulation (EU) 2021/378 of the European Central Bank of 22 January 2021 on the application of minimum reserve requirements (ECB/2021/1), (OJ L 73, 3.3.2021, p. 1–15)."

1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel noted that uncertainty had increased in financial markets since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 7-8 September 2022. This had occurred amid persistently high inflation and elevated fears of a recession, with increased attention on potential financial instability. Inflation concerns had remained the dominant driver of financial market developments, as inflation outcomes had continued to surprise to the upside, leading to a renewed adjustment of market expectations for monetary policy globally. Against the background of persistent inflation surprises, investors had sharply revised up their expectations regarding central banks’ “terminal policy rate” (the level at which market participants expected the current interest rate cycle to peak) as embedded in risk-free rates, for all major advanced economies, albeit to different degrees.
In the euro area, compared with expectations at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, market pricing and survey evidence now pointed to expectations of a faster pace of policy rate hikes and a markedly higher terminal rate. Forceful policy action was bringing about a tightening of financial conditions, with medium to longer-term real interest rates moving notably higher and risk assets continuing to be sold off. However, there was still a high degree of uncertainty about the extent of the policy adjustment needed to rein in inflation. At the same time, investors had gradually shifted their attention towards the side effects of the sharp global rate hiking cycle, amid tighter funding conditions for lower-rated entities, low market liquidity and heightened volatility in repo markets.
The heightened concerns about inflation had resulted in euro area risk-free yields being much more sensitive to news about inflation in 2022 than had been the case in 2021. In contrast, the relationship between risk-free yields and news about growth had remained rather weak, suggesting that market participants expected central banks to focus primarily on inflation.
In the United States, the adjustment of near-term rate expectations in financial market prices had been even more pronounced. Unlike in the euro area, the forward rate curve in the United States showed a marked inversion, signalling expectations of a reversal of rate hikes in the course of 2023.
In the euro area, real interest rates had increased across the entire maturity spectrum since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting. However, they were still deeply negative at short maturities and remained below the levels prevailing in previous tightening cycles, such as in December 2006, when inflationary pressures had been far less intense.
On the back of repeated upward inflation surprises and heightened uncertainty about the path of monetary policy required to tame inflation, market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation in the euro area had trended upwards in recent weeks. They now stood above the levels observed at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting, despite the sharp reappraisal of monetary policy expectations. Additional inflationary pressure could emanate from the ongoing depreciation of the euro. So far this year the euro had weakened by 13% vis-à-vis the US dollar. Considering that the bulk of commodities were denominated in US dollars, such currency developments had exacerbated the energy price shock.
The reappraisal of monetary policy expectations had led to a broad-based tightening of financial conditions beyond risk-free rates. The global sell-off in equity markets had continued also in the euro area, even though analysts had lately made only limited downward revisions to euro area firms’ longer-term earnings prospects and earnings expectations remained at a high level overall. Cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratios had come down markedly from the elevated levels prevailing during the extended period of accommodative monetary policy. They were now much closer to, albeit still above, their long-run averages since 2005.
In the euro area corporate bond market, the spreads of both high-yielding and investment-grade bonds had increased. Moreover, bond issuance by euro area non-financial corporations had declined markedly, especially in the high-yield segment. Developments in sovereign bond markets had so far been benign. Despite the sharp rise in risk-free yields, sovereign spreads vis-à-vis the overnight index swap (OIS) rate had remained broadly unchanged and had become less sensitive to changes in risk-free yields than before the announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument.
While the direct spillovers from the financial market turmoil in the United Kingdom had been limited, euro area financial markets had not been entirely immune. However, two mitigating factors were present. First, the euro area pension fund sector was comparatively small and concentrated, reducing the risk to euro area-wide financial stability. Second, interest rate derivatives were commonly based on the euro interbank offered rate (EURIBOR), limiting the impact of country-specific shocks on margin calls.
Regarding the transmission of policy rate adjustments to money markets, after the September rate hike the functioning of euro area repo markets had been impaired, though only temporarily. This had been triggered predominantly by concerns about additional cash flows into the repo market from the non-monetary policy deposits held with the Eurosystem. The tensions in the repo market also reflected the general scarcity of collateral and the abundance of cash to be deposited in the repo market in an environment of high uncertainty. At the same time, cash bond markets had continued to function smoothly.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Mr Lane highlighted that global economic activity had continued to slow in October. Global economic growth had seen a sharp reversal from a strong performance at the beginning of the year to a below-trend performance more recently. While data on goods trade had shown relatively stable growth rates until July, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for new export orders had in October been significantly below the threshold of 50, indicating a contraction. The filling of the backlog of orders still supported activity, while new orders were declining. However, the latest data showed that manufacturing firms had largely worked through the backlogs accumulated over the last year, suggesting that this channel would provide less support to the economy in the future.
Turning to exchange rate developments, in the past couple of years the euro effective exchange rate and the bilateral exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar had recorded a trend depreciation. However, since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting little movement had been seen in the effective exchange rate, owing to the fact that the Japanese yen had depreciated. In fact, the trade-weighted exchange rate had appreciated slightly since the September meeting. Looking at the determinants of the euro’s depreciation versus the US dollar in 2022, the differences in the expected paths of policy rates had played a big role. However, the deterioration in the euro area terms of trade, as the prices paid for imports rose faster than those received for exports, had also been increasingly important.
Regarding commodities, compared with the situation at the time of the September meeting, the prices of oil, metals and foods had not changed significantly. In contrast, there had been a huge decline in the spot price of gas, although the latest gas futures curve signalled a reversal of some of the drop in early 2023 and a stabilisation afterwards.
Turning to the euro area, GDP growth in the second quarter of 2022 had been boosted by a strong increase in private consumption as a result of the reopening of contact-intensive services. In this period the contribution to inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) from demand factors had also increased. In particular, the very large increase in private consumption had made a larger contribution to inflation.
The most recent indicators suggested that GDP growth had broadly stagnated in the third quarter of the year. For the next two quarters, the current assessment pointed to a drop in economic activity. However, this was very different from a scenario in which the euro area entered a prolonged period of negative growth. It was also very different from the downside scenario described in the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, as energy prices were currently much lower than had been assumed in the downside scenario. Moreover, the assumption of energy rationing leading to sizeable production cuts had not materialised, nor had there been a major increase in financial stress.
Survey-based sectoral indicators confirmed a continuing downward trend in manufacturing activity, despite the fact that industrial production had been supported by the filling of order backlogs and by the easing of supply bottlenecks. This support was not expected to continue in the future. PMI indicators showed that there had also been a significant slowdown in the services sector in recent months, while retail sales volumes had been on a declining path since June. Both manufacturing and services were experiencing a further increase in uncertainty, which affected the expected dynamics of demand.
Focusing on private consumption, consumer confidence had continued to decline in the period to September, before rising marginally in October. The European Commission’s consumer survey showed that households were increasingly postponing major purchases and reducing their savings in order to maintain their consumption of basic necessities.
The investment outlook had darkened significantly. Indicators of housing investment, such as building constructions and the PMI for residential output, had started to signal a contraction in the second quarter of this year and had continued to decline in the third quarter. Indicators of non-construction investment had also moved into contractionary territory in the third quarter.
The goods trade balance had continued to deteriorate, reaching a deficit of around 4% in August. This new record had been driven mainly by the rapidly rising import bill for energy. High energy prices were not only increasing import costs, but were also affecting chemical exports. The production of chemicals, which had a high energy content, had become very expensive in Europe, reducing the competitiveness of these products and their exports. On the services sector side, there had been a strong recovery in tourism indicators. However, the latest data had started to signal a return towards more normal levels.
Turning to the labour market, the unemployment rate had remained at a historical low of 6.6% in August. Employment and total hours worked had increased in the second quarter, by 0.4% and 0.6% respectively. That said, recent indicators were starting to suggest some weakening in the labour market. While the ECB’s latest Corporate Telephone Survey showed that employment growth remained in positive territory, firms had become more pessimistic about employment, which was in line with their sentiment about economic activity. A slowdown was also visible in the PMI data, although employment indices remained on the whole above the threshold indicating growth. While the PMI indicators for services and manufacturing were still above the threshold value, the indicator for construction had moved below it.
Looking at the tightness of the labour market, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons had increased significantly in the past two years, which was evident both from Eurostat data and from data obtained from the private digital job search platform Indeed. While both sets of data had suggested an increase in tightness in the period to the second quarter of 2022, the most recent indications from Indeed suggested a stabilisation of the ratio in the third quarter.
Turning to fiscal policies, structural balances were not expected to improve in 2022, as the reduction in pandemic-related spending was being compensated by new energy-related spending measures. These large energy spending programmes had in part been financed by the large revenue windfalls in 2022. As a result, while the overall euro area fiscal deficit was still expected to improve this year, it was unlikely to improve next year. Governments had announced further large packages of fiscal measures in their budgetary plans for 2023, which were likely to prevent any further improvement in their deficit-to-GDP ratios. While so far it appeared that spending on the newly announced measures would be reduced in 2024, it was still too early to assess how temporary and targeted the measures would be. The increase in interest rates was expected to lead to higher financing costs for governments.
Moving to the latest inflation developments, HICP inflation had increased further to 9.9% in September. The forecast error in the September projections amounted to 0.5 percentage points and was primarily related to the energy and food components. The projection for non-energy industrial goods inflation had been slightly higher than the actual outcome, while the projection for services inflation had been lower. Most countries had contributed to the September forecast error.
Since the weight of food prices in the total HICP was double that of energy prices, understanding their dynamics was very important. Consumer prices for food had seen a sharp increase and food producer price indices were rising. At the same time, growth in “upstream” prices at the start of the production chain – such as fertiliser prices and international food commodity prices – had started to decelerate. The fact that food producer prices were still on a rising path implied that more pipeline pressures should be expected for food consumer prices.
For goods prices, the most recent data showed that pipeline pressures on intermediate goods prices had started to ease, although these remained very elevated. However, pressures on consumer goods prices continued to increase, reflecting transmission lags.
Focusing on core inflation, i.e. inflation excluding energy and food, the decomposition into supply and demand factors showed that until July 2022 supply factors had continued to make a significant contribution, suggesting that the core inflation rate would come down significantly if supply factors eased. However, the decomposition also showed a steady increase in the contribution from demand factors.
Mr Lane recalled that core inflation was also affected by indirect effects of high energy prices, which were causing many energy-intensive sectors to raise their prices. ECB staff analysis, which divided goods and services into either energy-intensive or non-energy-intensive items, showed that a disproportionate share of inflation stemmed from the energy-intensive sectors. A stabilisation of energy prices would thus have important implications for core inflation.
Turning to domestic wage pressures, negotiated wages had continued to increase gradually over the last few months, even when the impact of one-off wage payments was excluded. The forward-looking information compiled in the experimental ECB wage tracker for the euro area showed wage agreements concluded in the third quarter of 2022 implying wage growth of 3.7% in 2023. This represented an acceleration compared with 2022 but was still a relatively moderate pace of growth.
Headline inflation in the euro area had exceeded headline inflation in the United States owing to much higher energy and food inflation. In the United States, however, core inflation was stronger than in the euro area, and it was very closely correlated with wage inflation. In the euro area, core inflation remained well ahead of wage inflation because the sectors with the highest price increases were not particularly labour-intensive but were relatively energy-intensive. Inflation in wage-sensitive HICP items had continued to increase in line with negotiated wage growth, which, however, remained relatively contained overall. These sectors had generally seen less inflation pressure than sectors more exposed to supply-chain problems.
Moving to price pressures related to housing, rental price growth had remained below 2% in September. It was thus exerting a dampening effect on services prices and on the overall inflation rate. However, other prices related to housing had increased strongly. The growth of owner-occupied housing costs had reached 10.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, the September projections suggested a significant deceleration in residential property price growth.
Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) reported in the October ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had remained basically constant at 2.2% for headline inflation and had decreased from 2.2% to 2.1% for core inflation. However, respondents had significantly revised up their inflation expectations for 2024 to 2.4%. Most of the responses continued to lie between 2% and 2.4%. But the average was affected by movements in the tails of the distribution, with an increase in the number of respondents who expected inflation to exceed 3% in 2024 and a marked decline in the numbers who expected inflation to be below 2%.
The September data from the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey showed that there had been no significant change since the increase in expected inflation that had occurred in March 2022. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to point to a sharp decline in inflation rates next year, from very high levels to significantly lower rates.
Turning to monetary and financial developments, bank funding costs had been gradually increasing, which reflected the changes in risk-free rates. Since early 2022 bank bond yields had risen by more than 300 basis points. Deposit rates for households and firms had also seen a significant increase and were expected to rise further in the coming months in the context of monetary policy normalisation. Rates on lending to firms and households had also increased and credit standards had tightened markedly.
The latest monetary data for September showed large shifts from overnight to time deposits, mainly on the part of firms and other financial intermediaries (OFIs). Households had also recorded their largest inflow into time deposits for ten years, but still continued to increase their holdings of overnight deposits. This deposit reconfiguration was in line with the increase in opportunity costs of holding overnight deposits since the beginning of monetary policy normalisation. The September monetary data also confirmed a drop in loan flows to non-financial corporations and, in particular, to households, providing further evidence that the tightening of financial conditions was being transmitted to the real economy.
Finally, Mr Lane reported the results of the October ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts. Compared with the September survey, respondents now expected the path of the key ECB interest rates to steepen and shift upwards by about 100 basis points.
Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that inflation remained far too high and would stay above the ECB’s target of 2% for an extended period. Inflation had increased again in September, to 9.9%. Energy price inflation had exceeded 40%, which was due to one-off effects but also reflected the ongoing pass-through of wholesale prices to retail prices. Food price inflation had also risen further, to 11.8%, owing to developments in both the unprocessed and processed food components. Measures of underlying inflation were at elevated levels. Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food had risen to 4.8% in September, from 4.3% in August, reflecting the impact of high utility prices on the cost structures of many sectors, the ongoing impact of supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand. Wage growth had continued to increase gradually.
At the same time, there were no clear signs of widespread second-round effects, and longer-term inflation expectations remained broadly aligned with the 2% target. Still, the increases in wage growth signalled by the ECB wage tracker were moderately above the levels embedded in the September staff projections, and wage pressures in the public sector could add a further impulse.
Overall, risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside. The major risk in the short term was a further rise in retail energy prices. Over the medium term inflation could turn out to be higher than expected if there were increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-through to consumer prices; a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy; a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target; or higher than anticipated wage rises. By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures.
Economic activity was likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter of the year and was expected to weaken further in the remainder of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. Higher inflation, lingering uncertainty and further cuts in the supply of gas from Russia had dampened consumer and business confidence and were expected to curb aggregate demand in the second half of 2022. The effects of the reopening of the economy that had boosted services over the spring and summer were expected to fade in the autumn and winter months. Households were concerned about inflation eroding real disposable incomes, with those on low incomes being especially affected. While supply-chain bottlenecks were gradually easing, the energy supply shock would continue to weigh on manufacturing activity and trade. In addition, global economic prospects remained clouded.
In line with these developments, available indicators and short-term estimates pointed to marginal downside risks for the third quarter of 2022 and to clear downside risks for both the fourth quarter of the year and the first quarter of 2023, compared with the September 2022 projections. A long-lasting war in Ukraine was still a significant risk. Confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. A weakening world economy could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area.
So far, the labour market had continued to be a source of resilience for the economy but, since it generally reacted with a delay to economic activity, it was likely to lose momentum. Accordingly, the weakening of the economy could lead to somewhat higher unemployment in the future.
Market interest rates had risen and broader financial conditions had tightened significantly amid expectations of faster and more substantial monetary policy tightening, both in the euro area and globally. Government bond yields had risen in tandem with risk-free interest rates, with spreads narrowing slightly, probably continuing to reflect support from the Transmission Protection Instrument and communication on flexible reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). Bank funding costs were increasing in response to rising market interest rates. This was making borrowing more expensive for firms and households. While bank lending to firms had remained robust, as they needed to finance high production costs and build up inventories, demand for loans to finance investment had continued to decline. Household borrowing for house purchase had reached a turning point in the summer. The latest bank lending survey indicated that credit standards had tightened, with banks becoming more concerned about the deteriorating outlook for the economy and the risks faced by their customers in the current environment. Banks expected to continue tightening their credit standards in the fourth quarter.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
In view of the protracted period of excessively high inflation and the risk that this may add to medium-term price pressures, Mr Lane proposed that the three key ECB interest rates be raised again by 75 basis points at the present meeting. With this third major policy rate increase in a row, substantial progress would be made in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation. Since the ECB’s policy rates were still accommodative, a large increase would underscore the Governing Council’s commitment to taming inflation by reducing support for demand and ensuring inflation expectations remained anchored at the medium-term target. As a further tangible sign of this commitment, it should be communicated that the Governing Council expected to raise rates further. The future rate path should be based on the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy, following a meeting-by-meeting approach.
In addition to further rate normalisation, Mr Lane proposed changing the terms and conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). During the acute phase of the pandemic, the TLTROs had played a key role in countering downside risks to price stability. In that period the ECB had granted exceptionally favourable conditions to credit institutions that borrowed via these operations, with the aim of sustaining the supply of bank loans to the real economy at a time when banks were likely to pull back and disengage from credit intermediation. At present, in view of the unexpected and extraordinary rise in inflation, the instrument needed to be recalibrated to ensure that it was consistent with the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of policy rate increases to bank lending conditions. It was therefore necessary to adjust the interest rates applicable to TLTRO III from 23 November 2022 and to offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates.
The proposed recalibration was proportionate. First, it would contribute to the normalisation of bank funding costs. The ensuing normalisation of financing conditions would, in turn, exert downward pressure on inflation over the medium term. Moreover, the recalibration removed disincentives for voluntary early repayment of outstanding TLTRO III funds, which would reduce the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. It was also expected to facilitate the release of securities currently being used as collateral with the Eurosystem, thereby alleviating collateral scarcity and improving the money market intermediation capacity of banks by reducing their balance sheets. This, in turn, supported a smoother and more efficient pass-through of the Governing Council’s policy rate increases to secured money market rates. Second, the proposed recalibration was more efficient than seeking to achieve the same objective through a shorter full-reinvestment period for the Eurosystem’s bond holdings or through more aggressive interest rate hikes. While amending the TLTRO III conditions might have side effects, the abrupt and unforeseeable change in circumstances justified a change in the policy stance if this was in the service of the ECB’s primary objective.
Moreover, Mr Lane proposed adjusting the remuneration of the minimum reserves held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem, to align it more closely with money market conditions. Given the high levels of excess liquidity, the marginal cost of reserves was currently anchored at the interest rate on the deposit facility, not the rate on the main refinancing operations. Changing the remuneration from the main refinancing operations rate to the deposit facility rate would thus restore the neutrality of the minimum reserves system.
Finally, Mr Lane proposed continuing to apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
Regarding the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation remained far too high and would stay above target for an extended period. In September euro area inflation had reached 9.9%, with soaring energy and food prices, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand having led to a broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation in recent months.
As regards the external environment, the latest data confirmed signals of slowing economic growth across countries and sectors and implied a substantial reversal of the pick-up in global activity recorded earlier in the year. It was observed that an increasing number of economies were expected to enter a recession. The concern was expressed that the cumulative impact of the slowdown, also including spillovers from synchronised monetary policy tightening, could even result in a “technical recession” at the global level. At the same time, reference was also made to easing global supply bottlenecks. Uncertainty surrounded China and the United States, with global activity being negatively affected by China’s closure of its economy and by the global fallout from restrictive monetary policy in the United States. At the same time, it was argued that lockdowns in China had led to declines in the country’s imports of liquified natural gas, with dampening effects on gas prices. In this regard, it was noted that spot prices for natural gas had seen an unexpected sharp fall in recent days and that the recent movements in global commodity markets had almost reversed the price increases posted since the beginning of the year. Some further alleviation of global energy price pressures was anticipated for 2023. However, it was argued that futures prices suggested some reversal of this trend and that, even after their recent decline, gas prices had been very volatile and were still many times higher than in the past.
Turning to euro area developments, economic activity in the euro area was likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter of 2022, with the weakening expected to continue during the remainder of the year and into early 2023. By reducing real incomes and pushing up costs for firms, high inflation continued to dampen spending and production. Severe disruptions in the supply of gas had further worsened the situation, and consumer and business confidence had fallen rapidly, also weighing on the economy. Demand for services was slowing after performing strongly in previous quarters, when those sectors most affected by the pandemic-related restrictions had reopened, and survey-based indicators for new orders in the manufacturing sector were lower. Moreover, global economic activity was growing more slowly, in a context of persistent geopolitical uncertainty – especially owing to Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine – and tighter financing conditions. Worsening terms of trade were weighing on incomes in the euro area. At the same time, the labour market had continued to perform well in the third quarter, with the unemployment rate remaining at the historically low level of 6.6% in August. While short-term indicators suggested that jobs were still being created in the third quarter of the year, the weakening of the economy could lead to somewhat higher unemployment in the future.
Members widely agreed that the outlook for euro area economic activity had deteriorated since the September monetary policy meeting. It was noted that all components of demand, including consumption, investment and exports, showed signs of weakening. Reference was made to the latest forward-looking survey indicators for economic activity, which had posted strong declines and were signalling a contraction. It was argued that a technical recession was becoming the baseline scenario and the most likely outcome. The view was expressed that, while real GDP for the quarter ahead had repeatedly been underestimated in previous staff projections, it was currently likely that the projection error would have the opposite sign. At the same time, it was cautioned that, so far, the hard evidence was consistent with a mild recession rather than suggesting a hard landing for the economy or a protracted downturn.
This distinction was widely seen as a key issue for the current economic picture and for the medium-term inflation outlook. A question was raised on the propagation mechanisms that could turn a shallow and short-lived recession into a deep and prolonged slump. Weakness in the banking sector had been a factor in past episodes but was likely not a key factor now, while the housing market – at least in some countries – might play a role. Another issue was what a recession would imply for the resilience of the labour market. In this regard, it was noted that the latest data for the forward-looking PMI survey indicators for manufacturing were down for activity but up for employment. At the same time, it was observed that the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons had remained much lower in the euro area than in the United States, pointing to a lesser degree of labour market tightness in the euro area.
It was argued that uncertainty and losses in purchasing power were the main factors behind the deterioration in the outlook, reflecting lower real wages but also lower real financial wealth, given that many households held their savings in low-remunerated deposits and debt securities. In this context, reference was made to analysis that pointed to substantially higher inflation rates for lower income households, since energy and food items made up a greater proportion of their consumption. This was seen as a reminder that inflation had substantial distributional consequences. It was argued that consumer confidence was likely to stay weak as long as inflation stayed high, as consumers had now lost a large part of previous gains in purchasing power. At the same time, it was recalled that there were still substantial excess savings accumulated during the pandemic crisis that could – together with fiscal support and a strong labour market – bolster consumption. In this context, it was noted that the findings of the Consumer Expectations Survey suggested that some households were keeping up their spending either by saving less or by liquidating part of their stock of savings.
Regarding fiscal policy, it was reiterated that fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable, in order to limit the risk of fuelling inflation. Policy measures should provide incentives to lower energy consumption and bolster energy supply. At the same time, governments should pursue fiscal policies that showed they were committed to gradually bringing down high public debt ratios. Structural policies should be designed to increase the euro area’s growth potential and supply capacity and to boost its resilience, thereby contributing to a reduction in medium-term price pressures. The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme would make an important contribution to these objectives. The solution to the energy problem was seen as mainly of a structural nature.
The point was made that the planned fiscal support appeared to differ across countries. Concern was expressed that, in the face of high energy costs, there was growing pressure on governments to support demand via transfers, which would then fuel inflation, instead of fostering potential growth through targeted public investment. While there was a risk that fiscal compensation packages would turn out to be bigger than warranted, also from a price stability perspective, it was also argued that the planned and expected additional fiscal measures were needed in view of the expected recession. When assessing the fiscal stance, it was considered important to include the EU funds. It was recalled that a recession would activate automatic stabilisers, which would increase spending at the same time as tax revenues declined. Moreover, as tax revenues had been bolstered by the “inflation tax”, the expected decline in inflation would have a dampening impact on revenues at a time when funding costs were rising as a result of higher interest rates, leading to a deterioration in nominal deficits.
Against this background, the incoming data confirmed that risks to the economic growth outlook were clearly on the downside, especially in the near term. A long-lasting war in Ukraine remained a significant risk. Confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. A weakening world economy could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area. The concern was expressed that, with the changes in the economic outlook, the economy was now closer to the downside scenario than to the baseline scenario depicted in the September ECB staff projections. However, a note of caution was voiced against equating the current outlook to the downside scenario. This was because the mechanisms were different, as regards both gas price developments and potential gas-supply rationing affecting production. It was argued that, in many respects, the outlook was more benign than the September downside scenario. However, in the meantime, other downside risks had materialised.
With regard to price developments, members generally agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation had risen to 9.9% in September, reflecting further increases in all components. Energy price inflation had remained the main driver of overall inflation, with an increasing contribution from gas and electricity prices. Food price inflation had also risen further, as high input costs had made food production more expensive. Supply bottlenecks were gradually easing, although their lagged impact was still contributing to inflation. The impact of pent-up demand, while weakening, was still driving up prices in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro had added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. Price pressures were evident in an increasing number of sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs feeding through to the whole economy. Measures of underlying inflation had thus remained at elevated levels. Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food had risen further to 4.8% in September.
Members underlined that the latest inflation outcomes were not at all reassuring. Data continued to come in above expectations. Concerns were expressed especially with regard to core inflation and the broader array of measures of underlying inflation, which appeared to be gradually increasing further and – with few exceptions – did not point to the stabilisation that had been hoped for and that had been embedded in the September staff projections. The continued strong short-run momentum was also confirmed by the upward trend in month-on-month increases in core inflation.
At the same time, it was pointed out that prices for natural gas had fallen. There were doubts as to whether, in view of the high volatility in the market, these lower gas prices would be sustained and should form the basis of a revised outlook. But it was also noted that the latest developments cautioned against simply extrapolating the very large impact that had been included in the September projections. The point was made that a correction in wholesale energy prices did not automatically imply a corresponding pass-through to HICP inflation. The earlier surges in energy prices had led to ever-faster impacts on inflation, and it remained to be seen how this would evolve when the commodity price surges were reversed. Changes and non-linearities in the speed and strength of the pass-through, depending on the size and persistence of the energy price shock, were typically not embedded in the models used for forecasting. It was recalled that what ultimately mattered was not wholesale but consumer energy prices, and that it was thus important to understand the pass-through mechanisms between the two and the corresponding time lags. The observation was made that long-term contracts could imply long delays, with significant upward pipeline pressures still working their way through.
References were made to various decompositions of inflation into underlying factors. First, it was noted that the rise in both headline and core inflation had come with an increase in demand-driven factors. Inflation could thus decline as a result of both supply and demand factors. Doubts were expressed as to whether, at the current juncture, relaxations on the supply side would be sufficient, and it was argued that a reduction in inflation would need to be driven mostly by a lower contribution from the demand component. Second, the decomposition of non-energy industrial goods inflation and services inflation showed that the non-energy-intensive components of inflation were also increasing. It was thus cautioned that any alleviation of inflationary pressures on the energy side could be offset by countervailing forces. One such force was exchange rate depreciation, which was negatively affecting the inflation outlook on a broad basis. More generally, the pass-through from producer to consumer prices was taking time and was still accounting for further upward pressure in the pipeline. It was recalled that the pass-through had recently been faster and stronger than expected and embedded in standard models. However, it was also argued that the quicker and stronger the pass-through, the faster the overall price adjustment would be completed and the earlier inflation rates could normalise. In this context it was seen as useful to also look at quarter-on-quarter inflation rates to get a better picture of inflation dynamics, given that annual rates were affected by base effects and carry-over.
With regard to wages, continued strong labour markets were likely to support higher wages, and some catch-up in wages to compensate for higher inflation was likely. Incoming wage data and recent wage agreements indicated that wage growth might be picking up. This could also be inferred from the statements of union representatives, employers and politicians. The tight labour market and the prolonged period of high inflation were seen as beginning to have an impact on wage growth. In the Corporate Telephone Survey, a large majority of respondents had expected wage increases to be above 4% in 2023. At the same time, it was argued that, even though growth in negotiated wages and in compensation per employee might be more dynamic, their levels were still moderate compared with inflation and there were no clear signs of a wage-price spiral. However, it was recalled that wages were a lagging indicator, and some doubts were expressed as to whether the still comforting picture provided by the experimental ECB wage tracker would hold up. It was considered unwise to assume that workers would simply accept the hit to real wages without a stronger response of nominal wages. There was a risk that future wage growth was being underestimated, as also suggested by more timely information on wages from job postings on private digital platforms, which were increasing faster than data on negotiated wages.
While it was argued that the euro area labour market was clearly a source of strength and resilience, it was cautioned that labour markets were still undergoing normalisation in the wake of the pandemic-related crisis, also with respect to the associated swings in productivity and sectoral reallocations. Hence, concern was expressed that this strength could be undermined if wages were overstretched in such a delicate adjustment period. Attention was also drawn to the unusual resilience of profits and profit margins in the light of deteriorating cyclical conditions, which was as important as wage developments when it came to factors driving inflation and inflation persistence.
As regards longer-term inflation expectations, most measures were currently standing at around 2%, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring. It was argued that survey-based measures had been trending upwards for some time and that market-based measures were pointing in the same direction, with no sign of a turning point. At the same time, it was recalled that market-based inflation measures contained an inflation risk premium, which had turned positive. A note of caution was added, to not only look at the upper tail of the distribution when assessing risks to longer-term inflation expectations but to include the lower tail. In the Survey of Monetary Analysts, the distribution appeared to have become more symmetric. Moreover, survey expectations had likely been measured at a cut-off date prior to the recent fall in gas prices and, if this fall were to persist, these expectations might see some downward adjustment. It was argued that, with actual HICP inflation standing at around 10%, longer-term inflation expectations had remained relatively well anchored.
At the same time, it was warned that the formation of inflation expectations was becoming more and more backward-looking. If actual inflation was not brought down in a timely manner, expectations would increasingly react to actual inflation and would, in turn, push it higher. In this context, reference was made to the substantial upward shifts in the expectations for headline and core inflation in 2024 as reflected in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, which pointed to an increased risk of unanchoring. An upward shift in medium-term inflation expectations had also been seen in the Consumer Expectations Survey.
Against this background, members agreed that the risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside. The major risk in the short term was a further rise in retail energy prices. Over the medium term, inflation could turn out to be higher than expected if there were increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-through to consumer prices; a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy; a persistent rise in inflation expectations above the ECB’s target; or higher than anticipated wage rises. By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures. It was pointed out that risks and their direction needed to be reassessed in the December Eurosystem staff projections.
One key issue was the extent to which a possible recession would limit upside risks to inflation in the medium term. It was argued that a shallow or technical recession was unlikely to keep inflation in check given its recent momentum and the risk that price increases would be difficult to reverse. However, reference was made to the downside scenario in the September projections, in which there would be a deeper recession in 2023 than in the baseline scenario and a higher inflation rate in 2024. It was commented that any dampening effect from a recession could be counterbalanced by an increased likelihood of second-round effects as a result of higher inflation in the short term, leading to greater inflation persistence and constituting an upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook. It was argued that there was an increasing risk of a vicious circle in which higher inflation expectations would feed into both higher prices and higher wages, and the concern was raised that such effects could be highly non-linear given the size of the shock. It was also argued that potential economic output might be lower than currently estimated. Lower potential output would imply higher inflationary pressures and could reconcile the difference between estimates of the unemployment and output gaps.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. Bank funding costs were increasing in response to the rise in market interest rates, translating into higher borrowing costs for firms and households. Bank lending to firms had remained robust, whereas household borrowing for house purchase had reached a turning point in the summer. The latest bank lending survey indicated that banks had tightened their credit standards in the third quarter of the year and expected to continue tightening them in the fourth quarter. It was pointed out that the transmission of the increase in bank lending rates to households was highly dependent on the fixation period for interest rates in mortgage contracts, which differed significantly across euro area economies.
Members agreed that financial conditions across markets and financing conditions for different types of borrowers had tightened significantly in anticipation of a faster and more substantial monetary policy tightening, both in the euro area and globally. Euro area government bond yields had risen in lockstep with risk-free interest rates, with their spreads relative to the OIS rate having remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s September monetary policy meeting. The spreads had been relatively insensitive to shifts in monetary policy expectations, which probably reflected support from the Transmission Protection Instrument and communication on flexible reinvestments under the PEPP.
In this context, it was highlighted that the Governing Council’s interest rate hike in September had not been transmitted smoothly to all segments of the repo markets. Use of the Eurosystem facility for securities lending against cash had reached its second highest level ever after the September interest rate decision took effect. Tensions in the repo market had also been reflected in the behaviour of the swap spread, i.e. the spread between OIS rates and sovereign bond yields of the same maturity, which had widened in some jurisdictions, partly owing to the scarcity of collateral.
It was remarked that financial market volatility had increased since the September Governing Council meeting, as evidenced by the bond market turbulence that was triggered by the announcement of the initial UK budget plans for 2023. The view was expressed that, for a long period, central bank policy measures had suppressed volatility to a significant extent and that some reversal of this situation could be considered a healthy return to more normal market conditions. It was considered noteworthy that volatility had been especially pronounced in markets that were traditionally considered low-risk, such as the money markets and the sovereign bond markets, with higher volatility in these markets since the beginning of the year than in the equity market. However, measures such as liquidity or bid-ask spreads indicated that euro area markets had continued to function well.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the monetary policy proposals, the view was widely shared that the inflation outlook continued to worsen, with inflation far too high and repeatedly above the projected figures. In addition, price pressures had become more broad-based, with a rising trend in core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation. These developments indicated an increasing risk that inflation might become entrenched and that second-round effects and a wage-price spiral could emerge. A return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% target was deemed unlikely without further decisive monetary policy action. Such action would also underscore the Governing Council’s commitment to bringing inflation under control and keeping inflation expectations anchored.
At the same time, it was underlined that, although wage growth was accelerating, it could still be considered moderate and there were no indications of a wage-price spiral at present. Moreover, price pressures originating from international commodity markets had weakened recently, and the expected economic downturn, together with higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, would dampen inflation in the medium term.
Although the economic outlook had deteriorated considerably, it was widely judged that the expected weakening in economic activity would not suffice to curb inflation to a significant extent and would not in itself bring projected inflation back to the target. It was argued that, in the event of a shallow recession, the Governing Council should continue normalising and tightening monetary policy, whereas it might want to pause if there was a prolonged and deep recession, which would be likely to curb inflation to a larger extent. In this context, attention was also drawn to the divergence between monetary policy, which was removing accommodation, and fiscal policy, which was becoming more expansionary.
It was reiterated that the Governing Council had to focus squarely on its primary objective and on bringing inflation back to target in a timely manner. Reference was made to the outcome of the ECB’s strategy review, which had underscored its commitment to act forcefully, using all available instruments, to address prolonged downward deviations from the target. The ECB now needed to show equal determination when inflation was above the target, countering far too high inflation and preventing it from becoming entrenched, irrespective of a deteriorating outlook for economic activity.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Against this background, all members agreed that, in view of the current inflation outlook, it was appropriate to continue normalising monetary policy by withdrawing accommodation to ensure that demand was no longer sustained. While the Governing Council’s monetary policy actions were having the desired effect on financial and financing conditions, the current setting of the ECB’s key policy rates was judged to be still accommodative, which implied that they should be increased further. The view was widely shared that monetary policy normalisation had to continue in order to counter the risk of long-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored and of a possible wage-price spiral. Successive inflation figures above the projections, heightened uncertainty and the prevailing upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as warranting further action.
Turning to the size of the rate increase, Mr Lane’s proposal to raise the key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points was supported by a very large majority of members. A 75 basis point increase was judged to be an appropriate response in view of the protracted period of excessively high inflation and the risk that this might add to medium-term price pressures. It was recalled that the monetary policy stance was still accommodative and argued that a 75 basis point increase constituted a necessary step toward a more neutral level. It would also amount to a further frontloading of interest rate increases, allowing a neutral level to be reached swiftly. Moreover, it was noted that market participants were pricing in an increase of this size. It was argued that falling short of these market expectations would imply an unwelcome loosening impulse, potentially undermining confidence in the Governing Council’s commitment to price stability. The view was held that feeding uncertainty as regards the way the Governing Council would react to the inflation outlook could further increase the volatility of risk-free interest rates in the present environment. It was also argued that, when the persistence of high inflation was uncertain, optimal policy called for a forceful response to reduce the risk of inflation remaining high for too long.
A few members expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, taking into account that the rate hike would be accompanied by a signal on the need for further future rate hikes, by a change in the remuneration of minimum reserves, and by the adjustment of the terms and conditions of TLTRO III, all of which would imply some additional monetary policy tightening. While the direction of monetary policy was clear, prudence was necessary as regards the pace of the adjustment. A 50 basis point hike was deemed sufficient to adjust the monetary policy stance in a gradual and measured way given that market sentiment was fragile, the risk of a significant slowdown in economic activity was increasing and financing conditions had already tightened significantly since the start of the normalisation process. Moreover, it was argued that an overly aggressive pace of tightening could have repercussions for financial stability, economic activity and ultimately inflation.
While it was widely felt that, with a 75 basis point increase, the Governing Council would make substantial progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation, it was also clear that rates would need to be raised further to reach a level that would deliver on the ECB’s 2% medium-term target, although decisions would need to be based on incoming data and the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy. Overall, in the light of prevailing uncertainties, there was broad support for a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to taking monetary policy decisions.
A discussion took place on the use of concepts such as the “neutral rate” or the “terminal rate” consistent with inflation returning to target over the medium term, with different views expressed on the link between these measures and projection scenarios or on their steady state properties. At the same time, while the difficulty of relying on precise values of these rates was acknowledged, there was agreement that, looking ahead, the Governing Council needed to continue removing accommodation with further interest rate hikes. Moreover, the view was expressed that monetary tightening would probably need to continue after the monetary policy stance had been normalised and moved into broadly neutral territory. With respect to the December monetary policy meeting, it was noted that the Governing Council would have more information available, which was seen as especially valuable in the light of the high market volatility and uncertainty that characterised the current environment. Moreover, the December staff projections would provide more information over a horizon extending up to 2025, including an assessment of how the increased recession risks, the development of commodity prices and the tightening of financial conditions since the September meeting would affect the medium-term inflation outlook.
Turning to the ECB’s outstanding lending operations, members unanimously agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to change the terms and conditions of TLTRO III. The adjustment was seen as an essential part of the ongoing monetary policy normalisation process and the recalibration of the Governing Council’s toolkit to ensure consistency across all monetary policy instruments. Moreover, it was in line with the Governing Council’s communication that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target. Since the last recalibration of TLTRO III in December 2020 the inflation outlook had changed fundamentally, in part owing to the war against Ukraine, which had led to an energy crisis that could not have been foreseen at the time. Accordingly, the Governing Council had to recalibrate its monetary policy stance, including the terms and conditions of TLTRO III, in order to pursue its price stability mandate. In the light of the worsening inflation outlook and the still negative short-term real interest rates, monetary policy transmission had to be accelerated.
The view was widely held that a change in the TLTRO III conditions would reinforce the transmission of changes in the policy rates to bank funding costs and bank lending conditions for households and firms, which to date did not fully reflect the intended monetary policy tightening. Moreover, it was argued that maintaining the average TLTRO III rate for the remaining lifetime of the operations at a rate below the deposit facility rate risked blurring the intended policy signal, which could call into question the Governing Council’s determination to bring inflation back to its medium-term target of 2% in a timely manner.
It was noted that with the adjustment of the TLTRO III conditions banks would have the incentive and the opportunity for early repayment of their borrowing, which would also contribute to the normalisation of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. Such a decrease in the size of the balance sheet was judged to be necessary and a helpful first step before considering a reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio. Finally, it was noted that a repayment of TLTRO III funds would reduce banks’ need for collateral, which could flow back to the market and thereby help to alleviate the collateral scarcity that had led to repo market tensions.
Overall, members agreed that the monetary policy case for adjusting the TLTRO III conditions was strong and that the resulting effects could not be achieved through other measures, as indicated by Mr Lane in his proposal. Although side effects were acknowledged, these were seen not to outweigh the benefits from the TLTRO III adjustment, which was required in order to maintain the effectiveness of monetary policy and thereby the Governing Council’s ability to attain its medium-term inflation target in a timely manner. In consideration of all these arguments, the adjustment was therefore judged to be proportionate in the service of the Governing Council’s mandate.
Members further agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to lower the remuneration of the minimum reserves held by euro area credit institutions with the Eurosystem, from the rate on the main refinancing operations to the deposit facility rate, in order to align it more closely with money market conditions.
Members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the PEPP portfolio. Retaining the existing flexibility in PEPP reinvestments was seen as a prudent approach to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic, which still persisted in the current market environment.
Looking beyond the configuration of the key ECB interest rates, it was underlined that the Eurosystem’s large bond portfolios were continuing to provide further significant monetary policy accommodation by compressing term premia. Allowing the downward pressure on term premia to decline would facilitate more efficient setting of monetary policy, thereby helping to contain inflation. In this respect, it was seen as necessary, following an assessment of the repayments resulting from the adjustment of TLTRO III and their impact on financial conditions, to discuss the reinvestment strategy for the APP portfolio at the Governing Council’s December monetary policy meeting.
Members widely concurred with Mr Lane that monetary policy should continue to be data-dependent and not follow a pre-set path, in accordance with a meeting-by-meeting approach to setting interest rates. To stress the Governing Council’s commitment to achieving its medium-term inflation target, it was seen as important to indicate that interest rates were expected to be raised further in order to guard against the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. Forward guidance on interest rates was widely seen as being of little value in view of the high uncertainty currently prevailing. In the same vein, indicating the size of future interest rate adjustments was seen as implying renewed forward guidance on interest rates, which the Governing Council had deemed no longer warranted.
The Governing Council stressed the importance of authorities addressing supply-side issues with appropriate structural and macroprudential policies, which would support monetary policy in ensuring price stability. Finally, it was seen as appropriate to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target of 2%.
The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

Credit standards tightened substantially for households and firms
Loan demand from firms increased, driven by high input costs and inventories building
Loan demand from households decreased in a context of higher interest rates and lower confidence
According to the October 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further (net percentage of banks standing at 19%) in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1). With regard to loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 32%) and a lesser, but still pronounced, net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 21%). In the context of economic slowdown and intensifying recession fears, the risks related to the economic outlook, as well as industry or firm-specific situations and banks’ declining risk tolerance all had a considerable tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms. With the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms, which was larger than in the previous survey round. In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a significantly stronger net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms. In addition, euro area banks expect credit standards to continue to tighten for both housing loans and consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened for loans to firms and loans to households in the third quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, both loan margins and other terms and conditions had a tightening effect. For house purchase loans and consumer credit, despite the net tightening of terms and conditions, loan margins (with margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) narrowed, reflecting in part that market reference rates have increased faster than interest rates on loans to households.
Banks reported, on balance, an increase in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital and inventories, in the context of inflated production costs, growing inventories due to the slowdown in demand and precautionary behaviour against the background of supply bottlenecks. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, in line with the expected slowdown in investment. In the context of monetary policy normalisation, banks have started to indicate a negative contribution from the general level of interest rates to loan demand. In the third quarter of 2022 net demand for housing loans fell substantially, while demand for consumer credit and other lending to households also decreased in net terms. The net decrease in demand for loans to households was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates and declining consumer confidence. For the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a net decrease in firms’ demand for loans. For households, banks expect a further strong net decrease in the demand for housing loans and a lesser, but still relatively strong, fall in demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail funding, securitisation and particularly medium-to-long term debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, in the third quarter of 2022. This reflects the tightening of financial market conditions for banks as monetary policy normalises. Banks reported that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes had a negative impact on their liquidity position, market financing conditions and profitability over the past six months, in the context of the monetary policy normalisation and the ending of net asset purchases. Over the past six months, which partly covered the period in which the ECB’s deposit facility rate was still negative, euro area banks reported in net terms, that the deposit facility rate continued to have a positive, albeit small, impact on lending volumes to firms and households and continued to contribute negatively to bank profitability. Banks in the euro area indicated a smaller positive impact from TLTRO III on their financial situation and lending volumes, as well as a lower net easing impact on terms and conditions for loans to firms and households compared with the previous survey round.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the October 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the third quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the fourth quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The October 2022 survey round was conducted between 16 September and 4 October 2022. A total of 153 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

,"Introduction
The results reported in the October 2022 bank lending survey (BLS) relate to changes observed during the third quarter of 2022 and expectations for the fourth quarter of 2022. The survey was conducted between 16 September and 4 October 2022. A total of 153 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%. In addition to results for the euro area as a whole, this report also contains results for the four largest euro area countries.

A number of ad hoc questions were included in the October 2022 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes, the impact of the ECB’s negative deposit facility rate and of the ECB’s two-tier system, and the impact of TLTRO III on banks and their lending policies.
1 Overview of results
In the October 2022 BLS, euro area banks indicated that they have further tightened their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the third quarter of 2022, i.e. the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was considerably larger than the percentage of banks reporting an easing. In the context of economic slowdown and intensifying recession fears, risks related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ declining risk tolerance had a considerable tightening impact on credit standards. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms, which was larger than in the previous survey round. In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a significantly stronger net tightening for credit standards on loans to firms compared with the current quarter.
Firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the third quarter of 2022, despite banks’ expectations of a moderate net decline in the previous quarter. Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital and inventories, in the context of inflated production costs, growing inventories due to the slowdown in demand and possible precautionary behaviour against the background of supply bottlenecks. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, in line with the expected slowdown in investment. In the context of monetary policy normalisation, banks have started to indicate a negative contribution from the general level of interest rates to loan demand. In the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a moderate net decline in demand for loans to firms.
Banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and a lesser, but still pronounced, net tightening for consumer credit in the third quarter of 2022. The net tightening of credit standards for housing loans was the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008. The primary drivers were higher risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints also contributed to the net tightening. For consumer credit, higher risk perceptions also primarily contributed to the net tightening of credit standards, with a slight impact from lower risk tolerance and the cost of funds and balance sheet conditions. Loan demand by households decreased substantially in net terms for house purchase loans and decreased moderately in net terms for consumer credit. The general level of interest rates, lower consumer confidence and housing market prospects all contributed negatively to demand for house purchase loans. The general level of interest rates and lower consumer confidence also contributed to a net decrease in consumer credit demand alongside a moderate negative contribution from lower demand for durables. In the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a net tightening of credit standards for all lending to households. In addition, banks expect a continued strong net decrease in housing loan demand and a lesser, but still relatively strong, decrease in consumer credit demand.
In more detail, euro area banks have further tightened their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 19%, after 16% in the second quarter of 2022; see Section 2.1). This was in line with banks’ expectations from the previous quarter. Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the net tightening of credit standards in the third quarter of 2022 was slightly stronger than at the peak observed following the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, but below the peaks observed during the sovereign debt crisis and global financial crisis (net percentage of 14% in the third quarter of 2020, 35% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 65% in the third quarter of 2008). In the context of economic slowdown and intensifying recession fears, risks related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ declining risk tolerance had a considerable tightening impact on credit standards. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms, which was stronger in particular for costs related to market financing. The contribution from the cost of funds and balance sheet situation to the tightening of credit standards is stronger compared with the previous quarter and the strongest since 2012 (excluding the pandemic period). In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a significantly stronger net tightening (29%) for credit standards on loans to firms compared with the current quarter.
In the third quarter of 2022 euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of banks of 32%, after 24% in the second quarter of 2022; see Section 2.2), and a lesser but still pronounced net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (21%, after 9%; see Section 2.3). Both figures are stronger than anticipated in the previous quarter (24% and 13% respectively). In the case of housing loans, this is the largest recorded net tightening since the fourth quarter of 2008. The net tightening for housing loans was driven mainly by higher risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints also had a tightening impact, while competition had a neutral impact. For consumer credit, increased risk perceptions mainly contributed to the net tightening, while the contribution from decreased risk tolerance and the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints was less strong. Banks expect credit standards to continue to tighten for both housing loans (32%) and for consumer credit (20%) in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e., actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises have tightened considerably further in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 19%, after 11%). Other terms and conditions related to collateral requirements and loan characteristics had a considerable tightening effect, while the widening of margins on average loans (net percentage of 6%; margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) and the widening of margins on riskier loans (net percentage of 4%) had a more moderate contribution. Banks also reported a substantial further net tightening of overall terms and conditions for both housing loans (net percentage of 24%, after 21%), and consumer credit and other lending to households (22%, after 11%). Despite the net tightening of terms and conditions, loan margins narrowed for both house purchase loans and consumer credit, reflecting in part that market reference rates are increasing at a faster rate than interest rates on these loans.
In the third quarter of 2022 banks reported on balance an increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 8%, after 1%). For housing loans, euro area banks reported a significant net increase in the share of rejected applications (31%, after 28%). This is the largest figure recorded since the series began in the first quarter of 2015. The share of rejected applications increased moderately in net terms for consumer credit (13%, after 5%).
Credit standards for loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase tightened across all four largest euro area countries in the third quarter of 2022 (see Overview table). Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households were unchanged in France and tightened in Germany, Spain and Italy.
Firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 13%, compared with 12% in Q2 2022; see Section 2.1), despite banks’ expectations in the previous quarter for a moderate net decline. Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital and inventories (net percentage of 32%), as firms face inflated energy and production costs, growing inventories related to the slowdown in demand and precautionary behaviour against the background of supply bottlenecks. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed investment had a dampening impact (net percentage of -11%) on firms’ net demand for loans, in line with the expected slowdown in investment. Sentiment indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) also point to falling private sector business activity for the third quarter of 2022. In the context of monetary policy normalisation, banks have started to indicate a negative contribution from the general level of interest rates to loan demand. Loan demand has strongly increased in net terms for short-term maturities, reflecting firms’ increased financing needs for working capital and inventories. At the same time, net demand for long-term loans was broadly unchanged in the third quarter of 2022. While available monetary data show strong long-term loan flows for July and August, given the leading indicator properties of BLS loan demand for growth in loans to firms, a potential slowdown in actual long-term loan flows would be expected in the coming months. In the fourth quarter of 2022, banks expect a moderate net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -4%), due to expectations for a significant decrease in long-term loans, while the demand for short-term loans is expected to remain strong.
In the third quarter of 2022, net demand for loans to households for house purchase decreased substantially (net percentage of -42%, after -10% in the second quarter of 2022; see Section 2.2). This is the largest decrease since the first quarter of 2012 (excluding the pandemic period). Demand for consumer credit decreased moderately in net terms after five consecutive quarters of increases in demand (net percentage of -11%, after 11%; see Section 2.3). The net decrease in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates (net percentage of -55%), consumer confidence (-36%) and housing market prospects (-22%). Together, these factors reflect the decrease in consumer sentiment reported by the European Commission related to the impact of high inflation and energy prices on households’ cost of living and of the recently observed increases in mortgage interest rates on the housing market. The net decrease in demand for consumer credit was also mainly driven by the general level of interest rates (net percentage of -17%) and lower consumer confidence (-15%). Consumption of durables made a moderate negative contribution to overall demand. For the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a further strong net decrease in the demand for housing loans (net percentage of -64%), comparable to the expected (although not realised) decline during the pandemic, and a lesser but still relatively strong fall in demand for consumer credit (net percentage of -17%). If realised, this decline in demand for housing loans would be similar in magnitude to the low of -63% recorded in the second half of 2008.
In the third quarter of 2022 banks reported on balance a net increase in demand for loans to enterprises in Germany, France and Italy, while loan demand decreased according to banks in Spain. Net demand for housing loans decreased in all four largest euro area countries. For consumer credit, it increased in France but fell in Germany, Spain and Italy.
Overview table
Latest BLS results for the largest euro area countries
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards or an increase in loan demand)
Notes: “Avg.” refers to historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.
The October 2022 BLS also contained a number of ad hoc questions. Euro area banks reported that their access to retail funding, securitisation and particularly medium-to-long term debt securities deteriorated in net terms in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions for banks. In the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a deterioration in access to all funding sources.
Banks reported that, in the context of the monetary policy normalisation and the ending of net asset purchases, the ECB’s asset purchase programmes had a negative impact on their liquidity position, market financing conditions and profitability over the past six months. Banks also reported that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes had a smaller net easing impact on their terms and conditions for loans to firms and housing loans, which is expected to change to a limited net tightening over the next six months. Similarly, the impact of the ECB’s asset purchases on lending volumes to firms and households for house purchase is expected to turn negative for housing loan volumes and become neutral for lending to firms over the next six months. The impact on credit standards was broadly neutral and is expected to remain so across all categories of lending over the next six months.
Over the past six months, which partly covered the period in which the ECB’s deposit facility rate (DFR) was still negative, euro area banks reported, in net terms, that the ECB’s DFR continued to have a positive, albeit small, impact on lending volumes for loans to firms and households. In addition, the negative DFR, on balance, continued to contribute negatively to bank profitability according to the banks and reduced lending rates. The DFR had also a negative, albeit lower, impact on the rates on deposits held by enterprises and households. Over the past six months, prior to the decision of the ECB’s Governing Council to raise the DFR out of negative territory, banks reported that the two-tier system (formally suspended in September 2022) mitigated the negative impact of the DFR on bank profitability, compared with the counterfactual situation in which no such system existed. Banks also indicated that the two-tier system contributed to a small extent to the increase in lending rates for firms and rates for deposits held by firms and households.
Banks in the euro area indicated a smaller positive impact from the Eurosystem’s third targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO III) on their financial situation and lending volumes, as well as a lower net easing impact on terms and conditions for loans to firms and households compared with the previous survey round. With the reduction in outstanding TLTRO III liquidity, banks expect an even more limited positive impact on their financial situation and lending volumes, as well as a more limited net easing impact on terms and conditions over the next six months.

General notes
The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 153 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.

BLS questionnaire
The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e. domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat, or (5) eased/increased considerably.
In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).
Aggregation of banks’ replies to national and euro area BLS results
The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.
In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.
[
3
]
For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.
In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares in lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.
BLS indicators
Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e. they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.
[
4
]
The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.
A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).
Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e. an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.
In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.
In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.
Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via the Statistical Data Warehouse.
A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on the ECB's website.
2 Developments in credit standards, terms and conditions, and net demand for loans in the euro area
2.1 Loans to enterprises
2.1.1 Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened
Euro area banks have further tightened their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the third quarter of 2022, i.e., the percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was considerably larger than the percentage of banks reporting an easing (net percentage of banks of 19%, after 16% in the second quarter of 2022; see Chart 1 and Overview table). The net tightening of credit standards was in line with banks’ expectations from the previous quarter. Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the net tightening of credit standards in the third quarter of 2022 is slightly above the peak observed after the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and below the peaks observed during the sovereign debt crisis and global financial crisis (net percentage of 14% in the third quarter of 2020, 35% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 65% in the third quarter of 2008). In the third quarter of 2022, the reported tightening in credit standards was somewhat stronger for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (19%, after 10%) compared to loans to large firms (17%, after 16%) and stronger for long-term loans (20%, after 16%) than for short-term loans (15%, after 9%; see Chart 2).
Banks indicated a considerable further net tightening impact of their risk perceptions and risk tolerance in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1 and Table 1). In the context of economic slowdown and intensifying fears of recession, risks related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ declining risk tolerance had a considerable tightening impact on credit standards in the third quarter of 2022. In addition, risks related to the collateral demanded also had a moderate tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises. With the ongoing monetary policy normalisation, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms, which was larger than in the previous quarter and similar in magnitude to that reported after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (7% in the second quarter of 2022). From a historical perspective, aside from the pandemic, this is the highest tightening impact of this factor since the second quarter of 2012. Banks indicated that the current tightening in funding costs was equally related to their capital positions (6%), ability to access market financing (6%) and liquidity position (5%). Competition related to market financing had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms. Banks also indicated that the main factors explaining the development in credit standards across firm sizes were higher risk perceptions related to the economic outlook, creditworthiness of borrowers, collateral demanded and decreased risk tolerance (see Chart 2). The net tightening of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints increased for loans to SMEs and large firms.
Chart 1
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Chart 2
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened across all four largest euro area countries in the third quarter of 2022. Banks’ higher perceived risks and lower risk tolerance were the main driving factors in all four countries. In addition, a tightening impact from cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, driven mostly by higher capital costs and banks’ access to market financing was reported by banks in Italy, Germany and Spain. For banks in France, the tightening impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints on credit standards for loans to enterprises was explained by banks’ liquidity position, while this effect was also a partial driver of the tightening in Italy.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a stronger net tightening (29%) for credit standards on loans to firms, compared with the current quarter, both for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 32%) and large enterprises (net percentage of 24%).
Table 1
Factors contributing to changes in credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 1.
2.1.2 Terms and conditions on loans to enterprises tightened considerably
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises have considerably tightened further in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 19%, after 11%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). This was mainly on account of tightening related to collateral requirements and other terms and conditions such as loan size, covenants, maturity limits and non-interest charges. The tightening in all these terms and conditions was stronger than in the previous quarter. Margins (defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) on both average loans (net percentage of 6%) and riskier loans (net percentage of 4%) have continued to make a moderate contribution to the tightening of firms’ overall terms and conditions. Tighter terms and conditions are confirmed by data on the actual aggregate cost of borrowing for firms, which increased in August 2022 (the latest available month). Banks reported a similar net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to SMEs and large firms, with collateral and loan characteristics summarised in other terms and conditions having a significant tightening impact on overall terms and conditions (see Chart 4). The widening of margins on average loans had a tightening impact on loans for both SMEs and large firms, whereas margins were widening on riskier loans for large firms and narrowing for SMEs.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “non-interest rate charges”, “size of the loan or credit line”, “loan covenants” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Chart 4
Changes in terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Note: See the notes to Chart 3.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions, decreased risk tolerance and increasing funding costs and balance sheet constraints were the main drivers of the net tightening in overall terms and conditions for loans to firms in the third quarter of 2022 (see Table 3). Risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of firms had a large tightening impact on terms and conditions, whereas the impact of the collateral demanded was more moderate. With the ongoing monetary policy normalisation, banks have indicated a further tightening effect of cost of funds and balance sheet constraints related to access to market financing, their capital costs and their liquidity positions. While competition had an easing impact on overall terms and conditions, competition from market financing had a small tightening impact.

Table 3
Factors contributing to changes in overall terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. See the notes to Chart 1.
In the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened on balance in Germany, Spain and Italy and eased in France in the third quarter of 2022. Across the four largest economies, banks mentioned higher risk perceptions, decreased risk tolerance and the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints as factors contributing to the tightening. Banks in France have indicated a narrowing of margins on both average and riskier loans. Margins narrowed on average loans in Spain but were unchanged on riskier loans, while margins widened on both average and riskier loans in Germany and Italy.
2.1.3 Rejection rate for loans to enterprises increased
In the third quarter of 2022 euro area banks reported on balance an increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 8%, after 1% in the previous quarter). This development is consistent with tightening credit standards, which make banks more likely to reject loan applications. The net increase in the share of rejected loan applications was similar for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 8%, after 4%) and for loans to large firms (net percentage of 9%, after 2%).
Across the largest euro area countries, banks reported that in net terms the share of rejected loan applications increased in Germany and Spain, driven by an increase in the share of rejected applications both for SMEs and large firms. At the same time, banks in France and Italy reported no change in the share of rejected applications in the third quarter of 2022.
2.1.4 Net demand for loans to enterprises continued to increase
According to euro area banks, firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 13%, after 12% in the second quarter of 2022; see Chart 5 and Overview table), despite banks’ expectations of a moderate net decline in the previous quarter. Demand strongly increased in net terms for loans with short-term maturities (net percentage of 18%) for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting firms’ increased need for liquidity to cover inflated energy and input costs. At the same time, net demand for long-term loans was broadly unchanged (net percentage of -1%) in the third quarter of 2022. While available monetary data shows strong long-term loan flows for July and August, given the leading indicator properties of BLS loan demand for growth in loans to firms, a potential slowdown in actual long-term loan flows would be expected in the coming months.

In addition, BLS banks indicated that loan demand increased in net terms for SMEs (net percentage of 12%) and for large firms (net percentage of 14%; see Chart 6).
Chart 5
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.
Chart 6
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes to Chart 5. Developments in the factors having an impact on loan demand across firm sizes were added in the April 2022 survey round.
Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital and inventories, as firms face higher liquidity needs (net percentage of 32%; see Chart 5 and Table 4). Inflated energy and production costs and growing inventories related to the slowdown in demand and bullwhip effects in supply chains are likely leading to a higher need for loans. In addition, against the background of continuing supply chain bottlenecks, precautionary behaviour of firms may lead to higher financing needs for inventories and working capital. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed investment had a dampening impact (net percentage of -11%) on firms’ net demand for loans, in line with the expected slowdown in investment.
[
6
]
Sentiment indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) also point to falling private sector business activity for the third quarter of 2022. In the context of monetary policy normalisation, banks have started to indicate a dampening effect (net percentage of -3%) of the general level of interest rates on loan demand. Debt security issuance, as a source of alternative finance, had a positive impact on loan demand, indicating that with the increase in market rates, banks substitute away from alternative sources of financing towards bank loans. In addition, other financing needs related to mergers and acquisitions and debt restructuring have supported loan demand to a small extent. In the current economic environment, firms might have an incentive to restructure their activities and might still have incentives to frontload their demand for loans or renegotiate loan amounts or maturities against the background of expected further interest rate increases. For both SMEs and large firms, financing needs for inventories and working capital had a positive impact on loan demand, while fixed investment (more for large firms than for SMEs) and the increase in the general level of interest rates had a dampening impact in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 6). In addition, loan demand has been supported by other financing needs related to mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring for SMEs, and by substitution effects from debt securities for large firms.
Table 4
Factors contributing to changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 5.
In the largest euro area countries, banks reported a net increase in the demand for loans to firms in Germany, France and Italy, while loan demand decreased according to banks in Spain in the third quarter of 2022. Financing needs related to inventories and working capital had a strong positive impact on loan demand in all four largest euro area countries, while fixed investment had a positive impact in France and a dampening effect in Germany, Spain and Italy. The general level of interest rates had a negative effect on loan demand in Germany, Spain and Italy, while it contributed positively to loan demand in France. Banks in France indicated that other financing needs related to mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring had a positive effect on loan demand, whereas banks in Germany indicated that other financing needs related to debt refinancing and restructuring had a positive impact on loan demand. Other financing needs related to debt refinancing and restructuring had a negative impact on loan demand for firms in Italy. Regarding the alternative sources of financing, substitution away from bank loans to equity issuance had a dampening impact on loan demand in France, whereas in Italy loans from other banks and non-banks had a dampening impact on loan demand for firms. In Germany, the positive impact of the use of alternative financing on loan demand was mainly driven by debt security issuance.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -4%), for both SMEs (net percentage of -3%) and large enterprises (net percentage of -4%). In net terms, demand for long-term loans is expected to decrease considerably (net percentage of -27%), while the demand for short-term loans is expected to remain strong (net percentage of 20%).
2.2 Loans to households for house purchase
2.2.1 Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened strongly
In the third quarter of 2022 euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of banks at 32%, after 24% in the second quarter of 2022; see Chart 7 and Overview table). This was stronger than expected in the previous quarter (24%) and the largest recorded net tightening since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Chart 7
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “banks’ capital and the costs related to banks’ capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “housing market prospects, including expected house price developments” and “borrower’s creditworthiness”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Banks’ increased risk perceptions, lower risk tolerance and higher cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed to the net tightening, while country-specific factors also had a tightening impact (see Chart 7 and Table 5). Banks reported a more pronounced tightening impact from increased risk perceptions than in the previous quarter, stemming from concerns regarding the general economic outlook, borrower creditworthiness and housing market prospects. This marks the third consecutive quarter of risk perceptions having a tightening impact, which excluding the pandemic period, had not been recorded since 2013. Other country-specific factors also contributed considerably to the net tightening, in particular in France.
[

]
Furthermore, there was also a tightening impact from banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints. At the same time, pressure as a result of competition from other banks had a broadly neutral impact.
Across all four of the largest euro area countries, credit standards tightened in net terms. Some banks in France noted that the usury rate (a maximum interest rate on loans) had contributed to a tightening impact.
[

]
Across all four largest euro area countries, increased risk perceptions and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a tightening impact, while competition had a neutral impact. Decreased risk tolerance had a tightening impact in Germany, Spain and Italy, but a neutral effect in France.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a continued pronounced net tightening of credit standards on loans to households for house purchase at the same pace as the third quarter (net percentage of 32%).
Table 5

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 7.
2.2.2 Terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase tightened strongly
Banks reported a strong net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 24%, compared with 21% in the previous quarter; see Chart 8 and Table 6). The net tightening for the third consecutive quarter reflects increases in the level of interest rates (recorded under other factors in Chart 8), in line with the substantial increase in euro area mortgage interest rates since the beginning of 2022. At the same time, there was a net narrowing of banks’ margins on both average and riskier loans due to relevant market reference rates rising faster than interest rates charged on housing loans. In addition, there was a moderate net tightening of loan-to-value ratios and other loan size limits (part of other terms and conditions in Chart 8) alongside an additional moderate tightening contribution from increased collateral requirements. Conditions for non-interest rate charges tightened slightly, while maturity limits were broadly unchanged.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes to Chart 8.
Banks’ increased risk perceptions, lower risk tolerance and higher cost of funds and balance sheet constraints all contributed to a net tightening of overall terms and conditions (see Table 7). Higher market interest rates in the context of monetary policy normalisation are feeding into banks’ cost of funds, while increased risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance reflect broader economic risks. Competition is the only factor which contributed slightly to an easing in terms and conditions.
In Germany, Spain and Italy, in net terms, overall terms and conditions for housing loans tightened while terms and conditions were unchanged in France. It should be noted, however, that loan margins narrowed markedly in France on both average and riskier loans because the interest rate on loans has not risen as quickly as market reference rates. Loan margins also narrowed on both average and riskier loans in Italy and on average loans in Spain. By contrast, loan margins in Germany widened. Additionally, German and Italian banks reported a tightening of both loan-to-value ratios and other size limits alongside increased collateral requirements. German banks also reported increased non-interest rate charges, while Italian banks recorded a tightening with respect to maturities. Regarding the factors, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a tightening effect on overall terms and conditions across all four countries. Higher risk perceptions had a tightening effect in Germany, Spain and Italy, while decreasing risk tolerance had a tightening effect for German and Italian banks, but a neutral impact for Spanish and French banks. Competition had a tightening impact in Germany and an easing impact in Spain, France and Italy.

Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.2.3 Rejection rate for housing loans increased strongly
In the third quarter of 2022 euro area banks reported, on balance, a strong increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for housing loans (31%, compared with 28% in the previous quarter). This was the largest net increase since the series began in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the tightening of credit standards and potential concerns regarding households’ debt servicing capacity from the higher cost of living and rising interest rates. The share of loan applications that were rejected increased in all four of the largest euro area countries.
2.2.4 Net demand for housing loans decreased substantially
Banks reported a substantial decrease in net demand for housing loans in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of -42%, compared with -10% in the second quarter of 2022; see Chart 9 and Overview table). This is the largest recorded decrease since the first quarter of 2012, excluding the pandemic period.
Chart 9
Changes in demand for loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation” and “regulatory and fiscal regime of housing markets”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal finance of house purchase out of savings/down payment”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”.
The current interest rate environment, lower consumer confidence and housing market prospects all contributed to this substantial fall in demand (see Chart 9 and Table 8). Together, these factors reflect the economic slowdown alongside increases in mortgage interest rates. The euro area composite cost of borrowing for households has increased substantially since the start of 2022, and rates are at their highest level since 2015 in August 2022 (the latest available data). BLS developments are also in line with the sharp fall in the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, this marks the first time since 2013 that housing market prospects have contributed negatively to demand, excluding the pandemic period, during which the negative impact was more contained. Other financing needs and the use of alternative finance made a small downward contribution to demand.
Banks in all four largest euro area countries reported a net decrease in demand for housing loans in the third quarter of 2022, with a particularly pronounced fall in Germany. Declining consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates had a strong downward impact across all four countries, while housing market prospects had a negative impact in Germany and France, a positive impact in Italy and a neutral impact in Spain. The use of alternative finance had a small dampening effect on demand in all four of the largest euro area countries. Other financing needs made a small negative contribution in Germany, France and Italy.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a further strong net decline in the demand for housing loans (net percentage of banks of -64%). This is comparable to the expected (although not realised) decline during the pandemic and is similar in magnitude to the series low of -63% recorded in the second half of 2008.

Note: See the notes to Chart 9.
2.3 Consumer credit and other lending to households
2.3.1 Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened
Banks reported a net tightening of credit standards on consumer credit and other lending to households in the third quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 21%, compared with 9% in the second quarter of 2022; see Chart 10 and Overview table). This is the strongest net tightening since the second quarter of 2009 (excluding the pandemic period) and is larger than was expected in the previous round (13%).
Increased risk perceptions of banks mainly contributed to the net tightening of credit standards (see Chart 10 and Table 9), which was mostly related to perceptions regarding the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of consumers. Increased risk tolerance and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a smaller tightening effect. Competition had a neutral effect.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms in Germany, Spain and Italy, and were unchanged on balance in France. Increased risk perceptions and the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed to the net tightening in all the largest countries. Changes in risk tolerance contributed to the tightening observed in Germany and Spain, but had an easing impact for French and Italian banks. Italian banks also reported tightening pressure owing to competition from non-banks.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a continued similar net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 20%).

2.3.2 Terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households tightened
In the third quarter of 2022 the overall terms and conditions applied by banks when granting consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms (net percentage of 22%, compared with 11% in the previous quarter; see Chart 11 and Table 10). While interest rates have increased (specified under “other factors” in Chart 11), there was a continued, although less pronounced, net narrowing of margins on average loans (net percentage of -6%) and of margins on riskier loans (-3%), as market reference rates increased faster than rates on consumer credit.
Chart 11
Changes in terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “size of the loan”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Reflecting this, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions contributed to a strong net tightening of terms and conditions (net percentage 29%; see Table 11). Increased risk perceptions and declining risk tolerance also had a tightening impact on overall terms and conditions, while competition had a slight easing impact.
Across all four of the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms. Despite the tightening of overall terms and conditions, loan margins narrowed on both average and riskier loans in Spain, France and Italy, but widened in Germany. Across all four countries, cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a tightening impact, while increased risk perceptions had a tightening impact in Germany, Italy and France, but a neutral impact in Spain. Pressure from competition had an easing impact in Spain and a tightening impact in Italy. Banks’ risk tolerance had a tightening impact in Germany and an easing impact in France.

2.3.3 Rejection rate for consumer credit and other lending to households increased
In the third quarter of 2022 euro area banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for consumer credit and other lending to households (13%, compared with 5% in the previous survey round). Excluding the pandemic period, this is the largest increase in rejections since the series began in the first quarter of 2015.
Across the largest euro area countries, the rejection rate increased on balance in Germany, Spain and Italy, but decreased in France. This broadly reflects developments in credit standards in these countries.
2.3.4 Net demand for consumer credit and other lending to households decreased moderately
In the third quarter of 2022 banks reported a moderate net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of banks at -11%, compared with 11% in the previous quarter; see Chart 12 and Overview table).
Chart 12
Changes in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 5. “Use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing out of savings”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”. “Consumption exp. (real estate)” denotes “consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans”.
The general level of interest rates and declining consumer confidence primarily contributed to this net fall in demand (see Chart 12 and Table 12). Consumption of durables also made a negative, albeit smaller, contribution to demand. These factors reflect the impact of the economic slowdown, increased cost of living and rising interest rates on loan demand.
Across the four largest euro area countries, banks in Germany, Italy and Spain reported a net decrease in demand for consumer credit, while banks in France reported a net increase. Across all four countries, the general level of interest rates and consumer confidence weighed negatively on demand. Decreased spending on durables dampened loan demand in Germany and Italy.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect demand for consumer credit and other lending to households to continue to decrease further (net percentage of -17%).

3 Ad hoc questions
3.1 Banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding
The October 2022 survey included a question on the extent to which the situation in financial markets has affected banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding.
In the third quarter of 2022, banks reported that their access to securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated in net terms, while there was a moderate deterioration in access to retail funding (see Chart 13 and Table 13). For retail funding, this is the first deterioration in access to deposits since the first quarter of 2020. The deterioration in access to retail funding is in line with the increase in euro area composite interest rate on deposits up to August (the last available data point). For debt securities, the deterioration was driven by a large worsening in access to medium-to-long term securities, while short-term debt securities remained unchanged in terms of availability. Access to money markets remained unchanged.
Chart 13
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)
Note: The net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “deteriorated considerably” and “deteriorated somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Table 13
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)
Note: See the notes to Chart 13.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect, on balance, a deterioration of their access to both retail and market funding, reflecting expectations of further monetary policy normalisation. Access to debt securities (net percentage of 22%), money markets (net percentage of 11%) and to securitisation (net percentage of 9%) are all expected to deteriorate. In addition, banks expect their access to retail funds to deteriorate driven by an expected deterioration in both long-term deposits (net percentage of 13%) and short-term deposits (net percentage of 6%).
3.2 The impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes
The October 2022 survey questionnaire included two biannual ad hoc questions gauging the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes. The questions take into account the impact of the ECB’s net asset purchases and the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities. Banks were asked to consider both direct and indirect effects of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes.
3.2.1 Impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on banks’ financial situation
Euro area banks reported, in net terms, that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes had a negative impact on their financial situation over the last six months in the context of the recent end of net asset purchases and monetary policy normalisation (see Charts 14 and 15). Banks reported that there had been a negative impact from the ending of the ECB’s net asset purchases on their market financing conditions (net percentage of -9%, after 13%), liquidity position (net percentage of -5%, after 8%) and a slight negative impact on their profitability (-2%, after -7%). By contrast, banks indicated a continued positive impact on their total assets (net percentage of 4%, after 6%), in line with the reported positive impact on lending volumes (see below).

Impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on bank profitability
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase/improvement)
Notes: See the notes to Chart 14. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Over the next six months euro area banks expect, on balance, that the impact of theECB’s asset purchase programmes on their liquidity position, market financing conditions and profitability will continue to be negative (net percentages of banks of -8%, -14% and -5% respectively). This is in line with monetary policy normalisation. The negative impact on profitability is expected to be mainly driven by lower capital gains (-9%), with the impact on net interest income being broadly neutral (-1%).
3.2.2 Impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on banks’ lending conditions and lending volumes
Over the past six months euro area banks reported a net easing impact from the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on their terms and conditions for loans to enterprises and housing loans (net percentages of banks of -3% and -8% respectively), while the impact was broadly neutral for consumer credit (-1%; see Chart 16). With regard to credit standards, banks reported a slight net easing impact for housing loans (net percentage of -2%"

Launch of new real-time gross settlement system and T2 rescheduled from 21 November 2022 to 20 March 2023
Additional four-month period ensures greater system stability and user readiness, as well as smooth transition to new platform
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to reschedule the launch of the new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and its central liquidity management model, T2. The go-live has therefore been postponed by four months, from 21 November 2022 to 20 March 2023. The decision, following an assessment by the ECB’s Market Infrastructure Board, was driven by the need to allow users more time to complete their testing in a stable environment. The decision also took into account the importance and systemic nature of T2, especially in view of the current geopolitical conditions and volatile financial markets.
While most users would have been ready for the scheduled go-live date, others would not have fully completed their testing. Delays encountered by market participants were also due to the temporary unavailability of the test environment and initial software deficiencies.
The Eurosystem will provide all the necessary support to market participants during their final preparations. Market participants that have not completed their testing successfully are encouraged to front-load their testing efforts in the additional period provided.
The consolidated platform brings together the RTGS system and the securities settlement platform run by the Eurosystem, thus contributing to the further harmonisation of European financial markets. It also unifies the technical and functional aspects of the TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities platforms and introduces new common and optimised features. In addition, RTGS will replace TARGET2 and optimise liquidity management across all TARGET Services. Four central banks (Deutsche Bundesbank, Banca d’Italia, Banque de France and Banco de España) act as service providers for TARGET Services. They are delivering the software and providing the test environment for the T2-T2S consolidation project.

ECB and People’s Bank of China extend bilateral euro-renminbi currency swap arrangement for another three years
Swap arrangement has maximum size of CNY 350 billion and €45 billion
Arrangement serves as backstop liquidity facility to address shortages of Chinese renminbi of euro area banks
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the People’s Bank of China (PBC) have decided to extend their bilateral euro-renminbi currency swap arrangement for another three years until 8 October 2025. The conditions of the arrangement remain essentially unchanged.
The ECB and the PBC established the first three-year bilateral currency swap arrangement on 8 October 2013, with a maximum size of CNY 350 billion and €45 billion. This was subsequently extended in 2016 and 2019, each time for a further three-year period.
From a Eurosystem perspective, the arrangement serves as a backstop facility to address potential sudden and temporary CNY liquidity shortages for euro area banks as a result of disruptions in the renminbi market. Liquidity-providing arrangements contribute to global financial stability. The arrangement with the PBC is consistent with the large volumes of bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China.

Compared with July:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months and three years ahead remained unchanged;
expectations for nominal income and spending growth over the next 12 months increased;
expectations rose slightly for economic growth over the next 12 months and edged down for unemployment in 12 months’ time;
consumers expected the price of their home to grow slightly more over the next 12 months, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to increase, with the median rate now standing at 8.0%, up from 7.9% in July. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Both the median expectation for inflation over the next 12 months and the median expectation for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged at 5.0% and 3.0% respectively. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead was stable in August compared with July. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations across income groups were aligned. (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.0% over the next 12 months, up from 0.8% in July. The improvement in expected nominal income growth was broad-based across income groups, except for respondents in the first quintile, who expected lower nominal income growth. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months continued to increase, reaching a new high of 5.8%, up from 5.4% in July. The largest increases came from higher-income respondents. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months rose further to reach 4.5%, up from 4.2% in July, owing to the increases anticipated by lower- and middle-income respondents. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months increased slightly from -1.9% in July to -1.7%. Consistent with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead were a notch down at 11.9%. Nonetheless, consumers continued to expect the unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.5%). (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. After a decline in July, consumers slightly raised their expectations for the growth in the price of their homes over the next 12 months to 3.4%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.4% and now stand 1.1 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Both consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and their expectations over the next 12 months tightened slightly again. (Link to Housing and credit access results and charts)

Decarbonisation to be based on issuer-specific climate score
Corporate bond holdings to be tilted towards issuers with better scores
Tilting to be applied to all corporate bond purchases settled as of 1 October 2022
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published further details on how it aims to gradually decarbonise the corporate bond holdings in its monetary policy portfolios, on a path aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. One goal is to reduce the Eurosystem’s exposure to climate-related financial risk, following the Governing Council’s July 2022 decision to tilt the Eurosystem’s corporate bond purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance. Furthermore, these measures support the green transition of the economy in line with the EU’s climate neutrality objectives.
The overall climate score that will be used to tilt bond holdings combines the following three sub-scores:
1. The backward-looking emissions sub-score is based on issuers’ past emissions. It looks at how companies perform compared with their peers in a specific sector as well as compared with all eligible bond issuers. Those performing better receive a better score.
2. The forward-looking target sub-score is based on the objectives set by issuers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Companies with more ambitious decarbonisation targets receive a better score. This incentivises them to reduce their emissions.
3. The climate disclosure sub-score is based on the assessment of issuers’ reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Those issuers with high-quality disclosures receive a better score. This incentivises bond issuers to improve their climate-related disclosures.
Issuers’ climate scores will affect their relative weighting in the benchmark guiding the Eurosystem’s ongoing reinvestment purchases of corporate bonds. This will result in the purchase of more bonds issued by companies with a good climate performance and fewer bonds from those with a poor climate performance. Additionally, the Eurosystem will use the climate score to adjust its bids on the primary market to favour issuers with a better climate performance and to impose maturity limits on bonds from lower-scoring issuers.
The Eurosystem will take the climate score into account in all purchases of corporate bonds – whether under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) or the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) – settled as of 1 October 2022. The overall volume of corporate bond purchases will continue to be determined solely by monetary policy considerations. The eligibility criteria for corporate bond purchases remain unchanged at this point.
The climate scores and the methodology used to calculate them will be reviewed regularly and may evolve to account for new developments in terms of data, models, regulation and risk assessment capabilities.
The ECB will start publishing climate-related information on its corporate bond holdings as of the first quarter of 2023 and will regularly report on the progress towards alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Tilting the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings as of October 2022 will mark the achievement of another milestone in the ECB climate action plan announced in July 2021. The ECB-wide climate agenda provides an overview of all ongoing climate-related activities.

Ceiling for remuneration of government deposits to remain at deposit facility rate (DFR) or euro short-term rate (€STR), whichever is lower, until 30 April 2023
Measure aims to preserve effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning
To preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to temporarily remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for remunerating government deposits. Instead, the ceiling will temporarily remain at the lower of either the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate (DFR) or the euro short-term rate (€STR), also under a positive DFR. The measure is intended to remain in effect until 30 April 2023. This change will prevent an abrupt outflow of deposits into the market, at a time when some segments of the euro area repo markets are showing signs of collateral scarcity, and will allow for an in-depth assessment of how money markets are adjusting to the return to positive interest rates.
As it currently stands, the relevant legal framework provides that, if the DFR is negative, government deposits are remunerated up to the DFR or the €STR, whichever is lower. It also foresees a remuneration ceiling of 0% if the DFR is 0% or higher. However, market and liquidity conditions have changed since this ceiling was put in place and a temporary adjustment of the remuneration arrangements, in a context of normalisation of monetary policy, is warranted. The new temporary change to the remuneration does not alter the long-term desirability of encouraging market intermediation, and the ECB calls on relevant depositors to plan for alternative arrangements to central bank deposits.
Government deposits are non-monetary policy deposits accepted by the Eurosystem from any public entities of an EU Member State or any public entities of the European Union, except for publicly owned credit institutions, as laid down in Guideline ECB/2019/7

and Decision ECB/2019/31

.
The revised remuneration will apply as of the start of the sixth maintenance period, i.e. on 14 September 2022, will remain in place until 30 April 2023 and will be reflected in an ECB decision to be published on the ECB’s website and in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. Based on its current assessment, over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. The Governing Council will regularly re-evaluate its policy path in light of incoming information and the evolving inflation outlook. The Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.
The Governing Council took today’s decision, and expects to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above target for an extended period. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, inflation reached 9.1% in August. Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressures in some sectors owing to the reopening of the economy, and supply bottlenecks are still driving up inflation. Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy and inflation may rise further in the near term. As the current drivers of inflation fade over time and the normalisation of monetary policy works its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation will come down. Looking ahead, ECB staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections and inflation is now expected to average 8.1% in 2022, 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.
After a rebound in the first half of 2022, recent data point to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of 2023. Very high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of people’s incomes and, although supply bottlenecks are easing, they are still constraining economic activity. In addition, the adverse geopolitical situation, especially Russia’s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine, is weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers. This outlook is reflected in the latest staff projections for economic growth, which have been revised down markedly for the remainder of the current year and throughout 2023. Staff now expect the economy to grow by 3.1% in 2022, 0.9% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.
The lasting vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic still pose a risk to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. The Governing Council will therefore continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 1.25%, 1.50% and 0.75% respectively, with effect from 14 September 2022.
Following the raising of the deposit facility rate to above zero, the two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves is no longer necessary. The Governing Council therefore decided today to suspend the two-tier system by setting the multiplier to zero.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio are being reinvested flexibly, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.

The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. Based on its current assessment, over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. The Governing Council will regularly re-evaluate its policy path in light of incoming information and the evolving inflation outlook. The Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.
The Governing Council took today’s decision, and expects to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above target for an extended period. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, inflation reached 9.1% in August. Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressures in some sectors owing to the reopening of the economy, and supply bottlenecks are still driving up inflation. Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy and inflation may rise further in the near term. As the current drivers of inflation fade over time and the normalisation of monetary policy works its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation will come down. Looking ahead, ECB staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections and inflation is now expected to average 8.1% in 2022, 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.
After a rebound in the first half of 2022, recent data point to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of 2023. Very high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of people’s incomes and, although supply bottlenecks are easing, they are still constraining economic activity. In addition, the adverse geopolitical situation, especially Russia’s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine, is weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers. This outlook is reflected in the latest staff projections for economic growth, which have been revised down markedly for the remainder of the current year and throughout 2023. Staff now expect the economy to grow by 3.1% in 2022, 0.9% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.
The lasting vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic still pose a risk to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. The Governing Council will therefore continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.

Ceiling for remuneration of government deposits to remain at deposit facility rate (DFR) or euro short-term rate (€STR), whichever is lower, until 30 April 2023
Measure aims to preserve effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning
To preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to temporarily remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for remunerating government deposits. Instead, the ceiling will temporarily remain at the lower of either the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate (DFR) or the euro short-term rate (€STR), also under a positive DFR. The measure is intended to remain in effect until 30 April 2023. This change will prevent an abrupt outflow of deposits into the market, at a time when some segments of the euro area repo markets are showing signs of collateral scarcity, and will allow for an in-depth assessment of how money markets are adjusting to the return to positive interest rates.
As it currently stands, the relevant legal framework provides that, if the DFR is negative, government deposits are remunerated up to the DFR or the €STR, whichever is lower. It also foresees a remuneration ceiling of 0% if the DFR is 0% or higher. However, market and liquidity conditions have changed since this ceiling was put in place and a temporary adjustment of the remuneration arrangements, in a context of normalisation of monetary policy, is warranted. The new temporary change to the remuneration does not alter the long-term desirability of encouraging market intermediation, and the ECB calls on relevant depositors to plan for alternative arrangements to central bank deposits.
Government deposits are non-monetary policy deposits accepted by the Eurosystem from any public entities of an EU Member State or any public entities of the European Union, except for publicly owned credit institutions, as laid down in Guideline ECB/2019/7

The revised remuneration will apply as of the start of the sixth maintenance period, i.e. on 14 September 2022, will remain in place until 30 April 2023 and will be reflected in an ECB decision to be published on the ECB’s website and in the Official Journal of the European Union.

,"Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 7-8 September 2022
6 October 2022
1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel started by noting that the narrative in financial markets had shifted since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in July. Initially, fears of a recession had dominated global asset prices and financial conditions had eased on the expectation that the pace of interest rate increases by central banks around the world would slow down, as a recession was perceived to do part of the job of bringing inflation back to the target level. However, more recently the focus of investors had gradually shifted back towards a tighter monetary policy stance as inflation outcomes had continued to be higher than expected.
In this environment, there had been four key observations. First, volatility in interest rate markets remained at historically high levels, reflecting very high uncertainty regarding inflation, as well as heightened data dependence of monetary policy. Second, monetary policy normalisation in the euro area was now expected to proceed at a significantly faster pace than had been expected at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting. Third, the summer rally in risk assets had been halted and partly reversed by investors’ reappraisal of the future path of monetary policy. Finally, the sensitivity of euro area sovereign bond yield spreads to policy rate expectations remained notably weaker than before the Governing Council’s ad hoc meeting on 15 June 2022.
Volatility in global interest rate markets and currency markets remained elevated. The heightened volatility in interest rate markets had primarily been driven by the uncertainty around the future course of inflation and the shift of monetary policy to a meeting-by-meeting approach, which had increased data dependency.
Regarding the change in policy rate expectations, markets had reassessed both the extent and the pace of policy normalisation. After reaching a trough in late July, the “terminal rate” (the level at which market participants expected the policy interest rate to peak) had rebounded markedly and currently stood close to the peak seen in mid-June. The expected speed of progress towards this terminal rate had also increased, as investors expected a less gradual tightening cycle.
The steeper expected policy path partly reflected the fact that investors attached an increasing probability to a scenario of inflation being higher for longer. Investors now expected inflation to peak in December, instead of September, as had been expected at the time of the July meeting. Options markets also pointed to rising upside risks to inflation, with investors currently pricing in a probability of around 15% that inflation would, on average, be above 4% over the next five years. Moreover, some measures of longer-term inflation compensation had started to creep higher again.
In the euro area, with the latest increase in front-end inflation swap rates, real short-term rates were expected to remain highly accommodative for some time to come. This contrasted markedly with developments in the United States, where, according to market-based estimates, comparable rates were expected to be in restrictive territory in 2023.
Ms Schnabel then explained how the reappraisal of monetary policy expectations had been transmitted to broader financial markets. Equity prices had increased notably during the summer, in spite of the weaker growth outlook, but had started to decline in the second half of August owing to increased concern about inflation – and the associated increase in discount rates – and weaker corporate earnings growth expectations. Yet, the decline in risk asset prices had been partly offset by an improvement in investor sentiment, as investors now required less compensation for holding risky assets instead of risk-free bonds. Overall, US stock markets were slightly down, while euro area markets were notably below the levels prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s July meeting. A key factor in this divergence had been the sharp rise in European energy prices, which weighed on households’ real disposable income and firms’ earnings expectations.
High energy prices in Europe and rising downside risks to growth in the euro area relative to the United States were also weighing on the euro exchange rate, as was the divergence of the expected path of the policy rate differential between the two economies.
In euro area fixed income markets, in tandem with the repricing of other risk assets, corporate bond spreads had temporarily narrowed during the early summer, in line with a recovery in investors’ risk appetite, before reversing some of the narrowing in August.
Euro area sovereign spreads had gradually widened, reflecting the shift in policy rate expectations. Yet, the link between spreads and interest rate expectations seemed to have become weaker since the Governing Council’s ad hoc meeting on 15 June 2022.
In money markets, the pass-through of the 50 basis point rate hike in July had been smooth, with some exceptions in the repo and Treasury bill markets. Specifically, there had been only a partial pass-through to German non-general collateral rates following the July hike, mainly reflecting the scarcity of German Bund collateral.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Mr Lane then went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area. After the unusually high economic growth rates recorded at the start of the year as sectors reopened, global activity had slowed to the average growth rates observed before the pandemic. The deceleration in trade, coupled with a fall in new export orders, pointed to a continued loss of momentum. Despite a reduction in the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for suppliers’ delivery times, resulting from weakening demand and the partial resolution of supply bottlenecks, the overall level of supply bottlenecks remained elevated. The euro had been depreciating since the start of 2021, driven in part by monetary policy expectations and the worsening terms of trade.
Turning to euro area activity, there had been a significant moderation in the manufacturing sector since the start of 2022, with the PMI for manufacturing output falling below the threshold of 50 – indicating a contraction – in the second quarter. The level of the PMI for services activity had been higher but was also weakening – even in the accommodation and food sectors, which had benefited most from the reopening of the economy. After the euro area economy had grown by 0.8% in the second quarter of 2022, mechanical short-term forecasting tools pointed to a substantial slowdown in activity in the third and fourth quarters.
Focusing on demand components, private consumption had recovered significantly in the second quarter thanks to a strong contribution from the consumption of services, while the consumption of durable goods had continued to be weak over the period. The European Commission survey pointed to a significant weakening of demand for contact-intensive services in the future, together with a weakening of demand for goods from already low levels. The European Commission’s uncertainty indicator pointed to a big increase in household uncertainty and in the perceived need for precautionary savings.
Moving on to investment, after a first quarter that had still been affected by supply bottlenecks and lockdowns, non-construction investment had recorded a strong growth rate in the second quarter of 2022. By contrast, the contribution of construction investment had been limited, with housing investment declining. Survey indicators suggested a moderation in non-construction investment in the second half of the year.
The euro area goods trade balance had stabilised at around 3% of GDP in June, with the energy balance resulting in a deficit of around 5% of GDP in the second quarter. The effect on income of the terms-of-trade loss amounted to about 5 percentage points, which constituted the income transfer to energy-exporting countries outside the euro area and implied 5 percentage points less available income for domestic spending.
The labour market had remained robust in the second quarter, but the PMI for employment signalled a moderation in the third quarter across all sectors. An analysis of the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate – the Beveridge curve – helped to better understand the dynamics in the labour market. In the euro area there was currently a historically low unemployment rate and a historically high vacancy rate. By comparison, in the United States the ratio of vacancies to unemployment was a lot higher.
Turning to fiscal policies, euro area governments had provided even more support in 2022, in response to the war in Ukraine, notwithstanding the scaling-back of pandemic-related measures. According to Eurosystem models, fiscal support had raised euro area growth by around 0.4 percentage points and lowered inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) by around 0.6 percentage points this year. Since the support measures were designed to be temporary, their unwinding was estimated to push inflation higher in both 2023 and 2024. Despite the higher fiscal support, the euro area deficit continued to be estimated to fall to 3.8% of GDP in 2022.
Moving on to the latest inflation developments, HICP inflation had increased to 9.1% in August. Energy continued to contribute about half of total headline inflation, but all other components also played significant roles.
The September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections featured a significant upward revision to inflation in the period to the third quarter of 2023. This was mostly due to higher energy and food commodity prices, but core inflation also accounted for an upward revision of about 1 percentage point. This revision, in turn, was related to the assumption of a speedier pass-through of energy and food inflation to core inflation. From the last quarter of 2023 onwards, the upward revisions were smaller.
The overall picture of broadening inflationary pressures remained in place. Many indicators of underlying inflation had shifted further upwards. However, in terms of momentum, as reflected in monthly changes, some indicators had started to flatten or had even turned slightly negative. This was likely due to the fact that these indicators were more sensitive to changes in oil prices, which had fallen.
Looking at pipeline pressures for goods price inflation, some measures remained robust. However, import prices for intermediate goods, i.e. goods in the early stages of the production chain, had moderated to some extent.
Services price inflation had increased from a pre-pandemic rate of 1.5% in 2019 to above 3% in July 2022. A decomposition into supply and demand factors showed that demand factors were making an increasing contribution to services price inflation in 2022. So, it was not only supply shocks that were important, but the recovery of demand also played a role. That said, it was important to distinguish between a recovery in demand and a situation of excess demand.
This distinction also mattered for the comparison of inflation in the euro area and in the United States. In the United States, the pick-up in core inflation was closely matched by a pick-up in wage growth. This was not the case in the euro area, where there was a clear disconnect between the evolution of core inflation and that of negotiated wages. In the euro area, inflation in items in the HICP basket with a relatively high share of wages in direct input costs had broadly followed the dynamics of negotiated wages and had thus remained quite contained overall. The large movements in euro area core inflation were instead due to other components, such as manufacturing goods and other items with a relatively low share of wages in direct input costs. It followed that the factors behind the increase in core inflation in the two economies were different, with wages playing a central role in the United States but not in the euro area.
Turning to the latest wage developments, in the second quarter euro area negotiated wages had grown by 2.4%. The experimental ECB wage tracker pointed to a gradual acceleration in wage growth over the coming quarters. Recently concluded wage agreements included increases of around 3%, on average, in the euro area for both 2022 and 2023. However, in the agreements concluded in the third quarter, wage increases for 2023 were slightly lower than in the agreements concluded in the second quarter. So far there had not been an accelerating trend in the data.
With regard to inflation expectations, the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) showed that analysts had been continuously re-estimating the inflation rate for this year and next year. However, for 2023, the projected inflation rate was 4%, which was significantly below the 5.5% inflation rate included in the September staff projections. The SMA also pointed to a stable 2% inflation rate for 2024. Three-year ahead inflation expectations, as measured by responses to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, had jumped in March this year and since then had continued to fluctuate around the March level.
Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased strongly for the near term. This increase largely reflected expectations of higher near-term inflation, but the energy shock and the uncertainty related to the supply of Russian gas had also caused inflation risk premia to increase. Looking further ahead, however, inflation compensation measures embedded a very steep decline, to around 2%, by mid-2024.
Mr Lane then recalled the key assumptions featured in the September staff projections. Compared with the June projections, oil prices had been revised down moderately, while gas and electricity prices had been revised up sharply. Short-term interest rates had also been revised up significantly for 2023 and 2024, with three-month interest rates now seen as being close to 2% for 2023 and remaining around that level for 2024. So a significant tightening of financing conditions was embedded in the projections, which reflected the ECB’s monetary policy tightening.
Moving on to the main features of the September staff projections, it was useful to look at some key figures expressed as changes in the fourth quarter relative to the previous year’s fourth quarter. This better captured the developments in the interim, cleaned of carry-over effects that were influencing annual averages.
Inflation was expected to average 9.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, relative to the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation was then seen to fall to 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and to 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. When looking at annual averages, inflation was expected to be 5.5% next year. The difference with respect to the 3.3% expected in the fourth quarter of 2023 was due to the fact that the annual figure for 2023 embedded a large carry-over effect, given the high starting point of the projection. Thus, the annual figures shown in the ECB staff projections featured a significant drop in momentum when looking at the quarterly inflation developments.
At the same time, the decline in core inflation was expected to be less pronounced. While the energy and supply bottleneck shocks were expected to have less of an impact, some catch-up in wages to recover the loss in real wages, on the back of a strong labour market, implied that core inflation would remain above 2% over the projection horizon.
Turning to financial and monetary developments, Mr Lane noted that the tightening of financing conditions had continued and its impact was spreading across the economy. Banks’ bond funding costs had seen a strong increase for both covered bonds and senior unsecured bonds. In addition, deposit rates for firms and households had started to increase. Both the nominal cost of firms’ debt financing and household borrowing costs were expected to increase further later in the year.
The volume of loans to firms remained strong, as firms preferred to borrow now rather than later, while the net issuance of debt securities was negative, as firms continued to substitute bond issuance with bank loans, given the relatively lower rates on loans. Loan flows to households remained solid, but lending for house purchase was showing the first signs of a slowdown. Forward-looking indicators pointed to a slowdown in private sector borrowing in the second half of the year.
Turning to developments in M3, there had been a significant moderation in money growth rates over the past year. After the end of the Eurosystem’s net asset purchases, money creation had been supported by bank lending, but as the growth of credit to the private sector was expected to slow, money creation was expected to decelerate further. Corporate and household deposit accumulation had normalised in recent months, with annual deposit growth rates standing close to their pre-pandemic averages.
Summing up, Mr Lane stressed that price pressures were extraordinarily high and likely to persist for an extended period. At 38.3% in August, energy price inflation had remained at extremely elevated levels and had again been the largest contributor to overall inflation, which had stood at 9.1% in August. Food price inflation had also risen in August, to 10.6%, from 9.8% in July, partly reflecting higher input costs related to energy, disruptions to trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions. Market-based indicators suggested that, in the near term, oil prices would moderate, but wholesale gas prices would stay extraordinarily high. While supply bottlenecks had been easing, these continued to gradually feed through to consumer prices. Recovering demand in the services sector had also contributed to the rise in inflation, and the recent depreciation of the euro had added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. Price pressures had continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation remained at elevated levels. Inflation could rise further in the near term. As the current supply-side drivers of inflation faded over time and the normalisation of monetary policy worked its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation would come down. Resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation were likely to support growth in wages. At the same time, incoming data and recent wage agreements indicated that wage dynamics remained contained overall. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.
The staff projections for inflation had been revised up, especially for the near term. Headline HICP inflation was expected to remain at very high levels for the rest of 2022 as a result of extremely elevated energy and food commodity prices, as well as the reopening of the economy and supply bottlenecks. Compared with the June projections, headline inflation had been revised up by 1.3 percentage points for 2022, 2.0 percentage points for 2023 and 0.2 percentage points for 2024. The upward revisions reflected recent data surprises, exceptional increases in the assumptions for wholesale gas and electricity prices, stronger wage growth and the depreciation of the euro. HICP inflation was projected to average 8.1% in 2022, before subsequently decreasing to 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024. The projected decline was largely attributable to expectations of falling energy and food commodity prices over the projection horizon. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was also likely to remain at elevated levels until the middle of 2023, but was expected to decline thereafter as the effects of the reopening of the economy subsided and supply bottlenecks and energy input cost pressures eased. The latest staff projections saw inflation excluding energy and food reaching 3.9% in 2022, 3.4% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.
After a rebound in activity in the first half of 2022, the latest data pointed to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023. Very high energy prices were reducing the purchasing power of people’s incomes and, while easing, supply bottlenecks were still constraining economic activity. Although employment had risen by 0.4% in the second quarter and survey indicators of employment perceptions still suggested further growth in the third quarter of 2022, high-frequency indicators signalled that job vacancies had started to plateau in July, possibly leading to a peak in the second half of the year.
The weaker outlook was also reflected in the new staff projections, notwithstanding upward revisions in the back data. Compared with the June projections, GDP growth had been revised up by 0.3 percentage points for 2022, with growth in the first half of the year higher than expected. In contrast, growth had been revised down by 1.2 percentage points for 2023 and by 0.2 percentage points for 2024, owing mainly to the impact of energy supply disruptions, higher inflation and declining confidence. The new projections saw real GDP growing by 3.1% in 2022 and slowing markedly to 0.9% in 2023. As the energy market rebalanced, uncertainty declined, supply bottlenecks were resolved and real incomes recovered over the medium term, growth was expected to rebound and to stand at 1.9% in 2024.
In the context of the slowing global economy, downside risks to the growth outlook had intensified, in particular in the near term. As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lasting war in Ukraine remained a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationing of energy supplies. In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. A further deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro area external demand.
The risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside. A further disruption of energy supplies was a major risk in the short term. Over the medium term, inflation could turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above the ECB’s inflation target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if energy costs were to decline or demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.
Market interest rates had increased in anticipation of further monetary policy normalisation in response to the inflation outlook. Credit to firms had become more expensive over recent months and bank lending rates for households stood at their highest levels in more than five years. The volume of bank lending to firms had remained strong, however, in part reflecting the need to finance high production costs and inventory building. Mortgage lending to households was moderating because of tightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence. Sovereign yields had moved broadly in line with risk-free rates, against the backdrop of the ongoing application of flexibility in reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and reflecting the unanimous approval of the Transmission Protection Instrument at the 20-21 July Governing Council meeting. Corporate bonds and equities had rallied for most of the period since that meeting, on the back of improving risk sentiment, but had lately fallen back as discount rates increased.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
Mr Lane proposed that the three key ECB interest rates be raised by 75 basis points at the present meeting. This major step would frontload the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that would ensure a timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. He furthermore proposed to communicate that, based on the current assessment, over the next several meetings interest rates were expected to be raised further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.
Mr Lane recalled that the monetary policy strategy stipulated that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target was context-specific and depended on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. With inflation expected to be well above target for a long period, in view of the net upside risks to inflation and taking into account the fact that the key policy rates were still highly accommodative, it was appropriate to take this major step. The communication of this decision should make it clear that the appropriate monetary policy for the euro area would continue to take into account the fact that the energy shock remained a dominant driving force behind inflation dynamics and the general economic outlook, including through the impact of the very significant terms-of-trade deterioration. In particular, the inflation dynamics associated with the energy shock component – to which the euro area was particularly exposed – were of a different nature to that of demand-driven overheating dynamics.
In line with a meeting-by-meeting approach to setting interest rates, the Governing Council should also underline that its policy would continue to be data-dependent and was not on a pre-set path, and that future interest rate decisions would reflect the evolving inflation outlook and the incoming data.
In addition, Mr Lane proposed that the Governing Council continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio.
Finally, Mr Lane proposed that the two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves be suspended by setting the multiplier to zero. With a positive deposit facility rate, the two-tier system was no longer necessary, as its role was to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy when the deposit facility rate was negative.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. After a rebound in activity in the first half of 2022, the latest data pointed to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023. Very high energy prices were reducing the purchasing power of people’s incomes and, while easing, supply bottlenecks were still constraining economic activity. In addition, the adverse geopolitical situation – especially Russia’s war in Ukraine – was weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers. This outlook was reflected in the September staff projections for economic growth, which had been revised down markedly for the remainder of the current year and well into 2023. Inflation remained far too high and was likely to stay above target for an extended period. Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressures in some sectors as a result of the reopening of the economy and supply bottlenecks were still driving up inflation. Price pressures had continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy, and inflation could rise further in the near term. However, as the current drivers of inflation faded over time and the normalisation of monetary policy worked its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation would come down.
Global economic activity had decelerated in the first half of 2022, on the back of supply-side disruptions and other headwinds, and growth momentum had weakened significantly over recent months. Looking ahead, weakening global activity would also weigh on global trade and euro area foreign demand, despite easing pressures on global supply chains, with global growth expected to remain moderate in the second half of the year as high inflation eroded real incomes.
In the context of a global monetary policy tightening cycle, members saw differences between the economic situation in the United States and in the euro area. In the United States, price pressures were more related to overheating domestic demand, while in the euro area they reflected, to a greater extent, imported inflation and a sequence of supply shocks. More visible wage pressures in the United States were seen to reflect the fact that the labour market had adjusted through an increase in redundancies rather than a reduction in hours worked per person employed. This implied that, at present, with a strong recovery in activity and employment, the United States was seeing a sharp rise in the number of job vacancies, which had led to a shift in the cyclical relationship between job vacancies and unemployment (as represented by the Beveridge curve). In the euro area, the relationship had remained stable overall. This suggested that the current higher wage pressures in the United States reflected a more pronounced labour market tightness than in the euro area. Moreover, the euro area had been more exposed to the surge in energy prices – particularly gas prices – since the start of the war in Ukraine, as the main driver of high inflation.
It was also noted that the trend depreciation of the euro over the past year, notably vis-à-vis the US dollar, could add to inflationary pressures for the euro area in the period ahead. The weakening of the euro against the US dollar could be explained by a number of factors. These included the different implications of the energy shock for the economies’ respective terms of trade, diverging cyclical conditions and different risks associated with the war and the energy crisis. At the same time, the faster tightening of US monetary policy was also seen to have played an important role.
Turning to developments in the euro area, the economy had grown by 0.8% in the second quarter of 2022, owing mainly to strong consumer spending on contact-intensive services, as a result of the end of pandemic-related restrictions. Over the summer, as people travelled more, countries with large tourism sectors had benefited especially. At the same time, businesses had suffered from high energy costs and continued supply bottlenecks, although the latter had been easing gradually. While buoyant tourism had been supporting economic growth during the third quarter, the economy was expected to slow down substantially over the remainder of the year. There were four main reasons behind this. First, high inflation was dampening spending and production throughout the economy, and these headwinds were being reinforced by gas supply disruptions. Second, the strong rebound in demand for services that had come with the reopening of the economy would run out of steam in the following months. Third, weakening global demand, also in the context of tighter monetary policy in many major economies, and worsening terms of trade would mean less support for the euro area economy. Fourth, uncertainty remained high and confidence was falling sharply. At the same time, the labour market had remained robust, supporting economic activity. More than 600,000 people had entered employment in the second quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate had stood at a historical low of 6.6% in July. Total hours worked had increased further, by 0.6%, in the second quarter of 2022 and had surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
With regard to economic activity, members concurred with Mr Lane that there were increasing signs of a downturn in the euro area that could extend into 2023. However, it was also highlighted that the economy had demonstrated considerable strength in the second quarter of 2022, with a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.8%. Looking ahead, it was highlighted that the baseline in the September staff projections did not suggest a recession, although it did foresee a period of stagnation around the turn of the year. However, it was mentioned that a range of models and indicators suggested that a recession was likely next year. If there were to be a complete shutdown of gas supplies from Russia, this could turn into an outright recession.
The reaction of domestic demand was considered a key element in the further transmission of high energy prices, as well as the less accommodative monetary policy. It was recalled that an important feature of the latest projections was that high energy prices would inevitably weigh on consumption as real incomes declined. In addition, business investment was expected to be worse than previously anticipated, especially as energy-intensive firms and firms operating in the energy sector might be exposed to financial stress generated by higher energy prices.
Members noted that, in addition to the negative impact from the surge in energy and other commodity prices, there was uncertainty about the distribution of the associated terms-of-trade loss among workers and firms. In this context, the view was expressed that it would take time before the income losses due to the terms-of-trade shock were fully absorbed, as firms and workers would seek to recoup lost profits and real incomes.
Regarding the fiscal policy response to higher energy prices, members agreed that measures should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable households and firms in order to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures. However, the concern was expressed that governments would find it difficult to keep measures targeted and to reverse them in a timely manner. The view was taken that, in the context of an adverse supply shock, governments were well advised to reduce their deficits and to put their finances on a structural consolidation path, especially in those countries where public debt sustainability might be called into question.
At the same time, the point was made that addressing the energy crisis as a supply shock required, first and foremost, action on the side of governments. It was argued that monetary policy primarily controlled inflation via a dampening effect on economic activity, with long and variable lags. It could not therefore control short-term inflation developments on which initiatives by governments and the European Commission could have a stronger impact.
With regard to potential output, it was commented that the impact of the war and the pandemic on the productive capacity of the economy was turning out to be bigger and longer-lasting than expected, so that demand might need to be reduced commensurately if inflation were to be curbed. If the supply side was hit harder than the demand side, this could fuel inflationary pressures even if real incomes declined. According to survey evidence, companies’ production constraints were mainly related to shortages of labour and equipment rather than insufficient demand. Hence the question was raised as to whether the output gap might have already closed, in line with indications coming from the unemployment gap that pointed to a potential underestimation of the role of capacity constraints in driving inflation. However, the view was also expressed that aggregate demand was still clearly below potential. All in all, it was clear that both demand and supply factors were playing an important role in determining the current degree of economic slack in the euro area.
Against this background, members assessed that, in the context of the slowing global economy, risks to growth were primarily on the downside, particularly in the near term. As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lasting war in Ukraine remained a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationing of energy supplies. In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. A further deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro area external demand.
With regard to price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation had risen further to 9.1% in August. Energy price inflation had remained extremely elevated, at 38.3%, and it was again the dominant component of overall inflation. Market-based indicators suggested that, in the near term, oil prices would moderate, while wholesale gas prices would stay extraordinarily high. Food price inflation had also risen in August, to 10.6%, partly reflecting higher input costs related to energy, disruptions of trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions. While supply bottlenecks had been easing, these continued to gradually feed through to consumer prices and were putting upward pressure on inflation, as was recovering demand in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro had also added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.
Price pressures were spreading across more and more sectors, owing in part to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation remained at elevated levels. Resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation were likely to support growth in wages. At the same time, the latest data and wage agreements indicated that wage dynamics remained contained overall. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stood at around 2%, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.
It was widely underlined that recent high inflation outcomes had largely been driven by higher energy prices. Recent developments in energy markets also suggested that headline inflation would not reach a turning point before the end of the year. Month-on-month inflation rates continued to indicate strong momentum. The argument was made that the nature of the inflation process was changing. Inflation had started to become self-reinforcing, to the point that even a projected marked weakening in growth was not sufficient to bring inflation back to target. This was also the message from the downside scenario prepared by ECB staff, which pointed to a significant recession with inflation standing even higher at the end of the horizon, well above the ECB’s target. Moreover, demand-side factors had become an important driver of underlying inflation, which also stood well above target in the baseline projection for 2024. Inflation had continued to broaden to more sectors and spending categories. Moreover, producer price inflation for core consumer goods continued to rise and the unprecedented size of pipeline pressures implied that firms would very likely continue to pass a substantial amount of these cost increases on to consumers.
However, it was also argued that inflation was still largely driven by the pass-through of supply shocks in the goods market, which appeared to be unwinding, with the exception of volatile gas prices. A recession was becoming increasingly likely and would mitigate inflationary pressures. With expectations still anchored and wage growth contained, there were no convincing signs that second-round effects were already materialising.
Members recalled that wage pressures were key to understanding the risk of higher energy prices having second-round effects on inflation. While wage developments in the euro area appeared moderate overall, there was evidence of differences between countries. In some euro area countries, labour markets were clearly overheated, which should ultimately lead to higher wages. However, while wages were a lagging indicator of the business cycle in general, and although a number of important wage negotiations would only take place in the autumn, it was generally observed that there were so far no convincing signs of second-round effects through wages. In this context, it was commented that the usefulness of ongoing wage developments as an indicator of future inflation pressures was questionable given that wages reacted gradually and with a substantial lag to labour market conditions in the euro area.
As regards longer-term inflation expectations, most measures of market and survey-based inflation expectations were considered to be broadly anchored and in line with price stability in the medium term. At the same time, it was argued that a number of indicators pointed to an increasing risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored. Consumers’ medium-term inflation expectations, as reported in the Consumer Expectations Survey, had gradually increased, and in July the median expectations for inflation three years ahead had stood at 3%. The mean of the longer-term inflation expectations reported in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters had increased to 2.2%, which was also a historical high. It was highlighted that a prolonged period of very high inflation had in itself increased the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored, in particular if they were being affected by recent experience, as suggested by empirical evidence. Higher than expected inflation figures exacerbated the risk of second-round effects via wages, creating upside risks to the inflation outlook. Projection models might be unable to fully capture the persistence and scale of the current inflationary episode. The expected decline in inflation towards the end of the projection horizon was therefore seen to be surrounded by a higher than usual degree of uncertainty.
Against this background, members assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook were primarily on the upside. In the same way as for growth, the major risk in the short term was a further disruption of energy supplies. Over the medium term, inflation might turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, a rise in inflation expectations above the target, or higher than anticipated wage rises. The point was made that an expansion of unfunded or partially funded government support could also constitute an upside risk to inflation. However, if energy costs were to decline or demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices. Reference was made to the very useful large set of sensitivity analyses carried out by ECB staff in the context of the latest projections. It was also widely felt that, at times of extraordinary statistical uncertainty around the baseline projections, the precise numbers foreseen for inflation at the end of the projection horizon mattered less than the assessment of risks, which were seen to be on the upside throughout the horizon, including over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. Credit to firms had become more expensive over recent months, and bank lending rates for households stood at their highest levels in more than five years. In terms of volumes, bank lending to firms had so far remained strong, in part reflecting the need to finance high production costs and inventory building. Mortgage lending to households was moderating because of tightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence. However, it was noted that, despite an increase in the cost of mortgages, credit growth had remained resilient. In parallel with the apparent resilience of the real economy, the banking sector was so far still holding up well, with bank profitability benefiting from higher operating income, lower operating expenses, lower loan loss provisions and better asset quality. This could be expected to mitigate the risk of negative feedback loops between the financial sector and the rest of the economy once economic growth slowed, even if pockets of vulnerability could still appear.
Although market interest rates had increased in anticipation of further monetary policy rate increases in response to the inflation outlook, it was maintained that market conditions did not show signs of destabilisation. It was also noted that financial market fragmentation had not reappeared since the Governing Council’s last monetary policy meeting, and sovereign yields had moved broadly in line with risk-free rates. Corporate bond spreads had also narrowed since the previous monetary policy meeting, while equity markets, except for the financial sector, had been broadly weaker.
It was underlined that the euro had depreciated by nearly 20% against the US dollar since June 2021, amplifying the energy price shock and adding to import price pressures for an extended period. Overall, financial conditions had tightened somewhat in the euro area since the last monetary policy meeting, while remaining relatively loose, particularly in real terms and when the exchange rate was taken into account. At the same time, higher market interest rates were starting to feed through to bank lending rates and financing conditions for the real economy, with further increases to be expected.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members agreed that it was appropriate to take a further step on the path of monetary policy normalisation. Overall, the current level of the ECB’s key policy rates was judged to be still highly accommodative; with inflation at 9.1% in August 2022 and the deposit facility rate at 0%, short-term real rates were deeply negative. Inflation was far too high and likely to stay above the Governing Council’s target for an extended period. It was therefore essential that it be brought back to 2% in a timely manner.
Inflation had repeatedly been higher than expected in recent months and inflationary pressures were seen as unlikely to abate on their own. The inflation projections had been revised upwards for the current year and for next year, while the projection for 2024 had drifted upwards over the past few quarters and now clearly exceeded the Governing Council’s target of 2%. Risks surrounding the projected inflation path remained tilted to the upside over the entire projection horizon. Moreover, month-on-month figures for headline and core inflation were rising strongly.
While it was underlined that supply shocks, in particular those affecting energy prices, were the main driver of the current high level of inflation and the worsening outlook, demand-side factors also played a role. While monetary policy was not equipped to address supply shocks, it clearly affected the balance of supply and demand. Hence it was argued that putting too much emphasis on supply-side problems could risk neglecting the fact that aggregate demand had to adjust to curb inflation. In this regard, it was maintained that the expected weakening in economic activity would not be sufficient to reduce inflation to a significant extent and would not in itself bring projected inflation back to target. This was seen to present the Governing Council with the difficult challenge of ensuring that inflation returned to target in a timely manner without unnecessarily exacerbating an economic downturn. However, it was also argued that growth concerns should, in any case, not prevent a needed forceful increase in interest rates. Moreover, it was remarked that, without a timely reduction in monetary policy accommodation, inflationary pressures resulting from a depreciation of the euro might increase further, while lower exchange rates provided limited support to economic activity in an environment of continued global supply bottlenecks and shortages.
While monetary policy could not prevent first-round effects from higher energy prices and the impact of supply shocks, its primary responsibility was to counter risks of second-round effects and prevent an unanchoring of inflation expectations. Such risks were increasing, with inflation becoming more persistent than initially expected.
Against this background, the Governing Council’s response to upside deviations from the ECB’s target ought to be as forceful as it had been when inflation had been too low. It was recalled that the Governing Council regarded deviations of inflation from target in either direction as equally undesirable. The ECB’s monetary policy strategy prescribed that price stability had to be maintained with a medium-term orientation, and the magnitude and persistence of the deviation from the Governing Council’s inflation target, as well as the context and origin of inflation pressures, had to be taken into account. At the same time, it was argued that acting forcefully now could avoid the need to increase interest rates more sharply later in the economic cycle when the economy was slowing down. Moreover, it was maintained that the longer high inflation persisted, the higher the risk that inflation expectations could become unanchored and the costlier it would be to bring them back to target.
Turning to the size of the interest rate increase, a very large number of members, in line with Mr Lane’s proposal, expressed a preference for raising the key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. A 75 basis point increase was judged to be a proportionate response to the further upward revisions to the inflation outlook and an important signal that the Governing Council was determined to bring inflation back to its 2% target in a timely manner. The fact that inflation had repeatedly been higher than expected and the upward revision to the medium-term inflation projections were seen as calling for a faster pace of monetary policy normalisation to keep inflation expectations anchored at the target level in the medium term. Market participants had priced in a larger interest rate increase than in July in response to the latest inflation data.
Since the deposit facility rate was, at 0%, far from a level that could be considered neutral in terms of monetary policy accommodation, and in view of the worse inflation outlook, progress towards a level that supported a return of inflation to 2% had to be frontloaded. While the Governing Council’s decision in July to raise the ECB’s key policy rates by 50 basis points had been an important first step in normalising the interest rate level, it was argued that policy would remain expansionary after a 75 basis point rate hike.
Some members expressed a preference for increasing the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. While a 25 basis point increase was seen as clearly insufficient to address the current inflation outlook, it was argued that a 50 basis point hike would be large enough to signal determination in proceeding with the interest rate normalisation that the Governing Council had begun at its July meeting. With the looming risk of a recession, which would mitigate inflationary pressures, an increase of 50 basis points, if part of a sustained path towards more neutral rate levels, might prove sufficient to return inflation to the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term once transitory shocks had faded. What needed to be addressed was the risk of the sharp rise in inflation, exacerbated by the war, destabilising inflation expectations. A response that was too aggressive could also exacerbate a recession, with few benefits for inflation in the short term.
So far, inflation expectations were still anchored and wage growth remained moderate, with little evidence of second-round effects. Moreover, the size of the upward revision in the staff inflation projection for 2024 was not seen as sufficiently large as to require a more aggressive response, since it was uncertain how much inflation was likely to dampen domestic demand and high uncertainty surrounded the projections, particularly towards the end of the projection horizon. It was noted that the euro area was less affected by excess demand than the United States. Supply-side factors such as energy played a much larger role in the euro area, wage inflation was more moderate and medium-term inflation expectations were better anchored.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
At the end of the discussion, all members joined a consensus to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, while reaffirming that the Governing Council’s decision remained data-dependent and that a 75 basis point increase should not signal that the Governing Council intended to agree on interest rate increases of a similar magnitude at its future meetings. It was seen as essential to communicate prudently on the way forward and to counter the risk of increased volatility in the bond market by referring to a frontloading of interest rate normalisation.
Members widely concurred with Mr Lane that monetary policy should continue to be data-dependent and not follow a pre-set path, and that interest rates should be set on a meeting-by-meeting basis. At the same time, it was considered important to indicate that interest rates would be raised further over subsequent meetings as part of the normalisation process.
Regarding the interest rate level ultimately required to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term and the time at which that level was to be reached, it was stressed that these were subject to uncertainty, model-dependent and context-specific, and changed over time. In addition, the “neutral rate of interest” depended on long-term trends in factors such as productivity and demographics, as well as the interplay between savings and investment behaviour. Hence, the concept was debatable, unobservable and difficult to measure in real time.
Despite these difficulties, there was broad consensus that, even after the current decision, the key policy rates would remain significantly below the neutral rate.
Looking beyond the configuration of the key ECB interest rates, it was underlined that the Eurosystem’s large balance sheet was continuing to provide significant monetary policy accommodation by compressing term premia. It was seen as appropriate to reiterate that the Governing Council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its medium-term target of 2%.
Members also agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio. Containing unwarranted volatility in sovereign bond markets was generally seen as an essential complement to a 75 basis point interest rate increase and signalled the ECB’s commitment to ensure a smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.
Finally, members agreed with Mr Lane’s proposal to suspend the two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves by setting the multiplier to zero, since the two-tier system was no longer considered necessary in view of the positive value that the deposit facility rate would reach as a consequence of the decision to raise the three policy rates by 75 basis points.
The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

Release of the next monetary policy account foreseen on 24 November 2022."
2 September 2022,"2 September 2022
Compared with June:
consumer expectations for inflation over the next 12 months remained unchanged, while those for inflation three years ahead rose;
expected nominal spending growth over the next 12 months continued to outpace expected income growth;
expectations declined for economic growth over the next 12 months and rose for unemployment in 12 months’ time;
consumers expected the price of their home to grow slightly less over the next 12 months, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to increase, with the median rate now standing at 7.9%, up from 7.2% in June. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, decreasing as the horizon extended into the future. The median expectation for inflation over the next 12 months remained unchanged at 5.0%, while that for three years ahead rose to 3.0%, up from 2.8% in June. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead edged up in July, having remained stable since March 2022. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations across income groups were closely aligned. (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their income to grow by 0.8% over the next 12 months. This was a notch down from 0.9% in June, putting an end to the rebound from the trough of 0.5% in March 2022. The decline in expected income growth was concentrated among middle-income respondents, with higher-income respondents by contrast raising their expectations for income growth further. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months continued the acceleration that began in March 2021, reaching a new high of 5.4%. The largest increases came from middle-income respondents. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months rose to 4.2%, up from 3.9% in June, owing to the significant increases anticipated by higher-income respondents. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined from -1.3% in June to -1.9%, their lowest level since November 2020. This decline was broad-based across income and age groups. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate in the next 12 months rose to 12.0%, reaching their highest level since September 2021. However, survey data available at a quarterly frequency showed that in July unemployed respondents raised their expected probability of finding a job in the next three months to 27.3%, up from 23.8% in April. Employed respondents, in turn, slightly reduced their expected probability of losing their job in the next three months to 9.4%, down from 9.5% in April. (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. Consumers again slightly lowered their expectations for the growth in price of their homes over the next 12 months to 3.2%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift up to 4.3% and now stand 1.0 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Both consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and their expectations over the next 12 months tightened again. Perceived and expected credit conditions are now at their tightest level since the start of the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) in April 2020. The share of consumers who report having applied for credit during the past three months, which is collected quarterly, further declined to 12.2% in July, down from 12.7% in April 2022.

Europa Open Air resumes after three-year coronavirus-induced break
More than 10,000 guests expected to enjoy musical evening with “celebrating Europe” theme
The Europa Open Air concert will take place again on Thursday, 25 August, after a three-year break. Held on the banks of the Main river, it is one of the most renowned concerts in the Frankfurt area and is jointly organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Hessischer Rundfunk orchestra, Frankfurt Radio Symphony.
The theme of the event is “celebrating Europe”. The programme features popular classics by European composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Frédéric Chopin, Claude Debussy and Mieczys?aw Weinberg, performed by Frankfurt Radio Symphony. The evening will start with a performance from Hessischer Rundfunk’s big band.
“This event, at a time when there is once again a war on European soil, should serve as a reminder that we want to live in a society that is free and open, in which solidarity prevails over aggression. Europe is what unites us,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The concert will be broadcast live on German TV and radio and over the internet. Further information can be found on Hessischer Rundfunk’s website.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-March 2022, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector and comprise a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-March 2022 data refer to 318 banking groups and 2457 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s implementing technical standards on supervisory reporting, while some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
A few revisions to past data are disclosed together with the end-March 2022 data.

The Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) is a monthly online survey collecting timely information on the perceptions and expectations of consumers in the euro area, as well as their economic and financial behaviour. The topics covered in the CES range from inflation, consumption and income, housing market activity and house prices to labour market conditions, consumer finance, savings and investment, borrowing and credit access conditions, the general economic outlook and other central bank-related subjects. The information collected in the CES can, thus help complement other ECB surveys. The CES is currently based on around 14,000 interviewed consumers, aged 18 and above, from six euro area countries: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands. These countries represent 85% of euro area overall GDP and 83.8% of the total euro area population.
The survey helps us pursue our price stability mandate by improving the analytical basis for the ECB’s economic and monetary analysis. This in turn improves our understanding of financial vulnerabilities in the household sector and challenges to financial stability.
Starting in August 2022, the results of the CES are published on a monthly basis on the ECB’s website here: CES webpage.
CES latest results – June 2022
Compared to May, consumers now expect that in 12 months’ time:
Inflation will be higher;
Income growth will remain unchanged while nominal spending will rise considerably more than income;
Economic growth will be more negative and unemployment will rise;
House price growth will be slightly lower and mortgage interest rates will continue drifting up.
Inflation. Consumers’ perceived inflation over the past 12 months increased markedly, as did their expectations for future inflation. The median perceived inflation rate over the past 12 months rose to 7.2% from 6.6% in May, while the median expectation for inflation 12 months ahead only edged up to 5.0%. Inflation expectations three years ahead also increased noticeably to 2.8%, from 2.5% in May. Consumers’ uncertainty about inflation has stabilised since March after rising over the preceding months. (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Expectations for nominal income growth 12 months ahead were unchanged at 0.9%. They remain higher for consumers aged 18-34 (at 1.8%) and for those with very low incomes. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the past 12 months kept rising since April 2021, reaching 5.0%. Consumers with below-median incomes continued to perceive the highest nominal spending growth. Concerning future nominal spending growth, respondents’ expectations 12 months ahead edged up to 3.9%. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations 12 months ahead were slightly more negative than in May at -1.3% and broad-based across income and age groups. Consumers’ expectations turned negative in March 2022, dropping to a low of -1.8%, but the expected decline has moderated since then. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead increased to 11.5%, close to the levels recorded at the beginning of the year. In April 2022, quarterly data show that respondents who are unemployed had cut their expectations of finding a job over the next three months from 26.7% in January to 23.8%. The expected probability of job loss over the next three months also fell to 9.5% from 10.3% in January. (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. Consumers’ expectations about the price growth of their home 12 months ahead declined marginally to 3.3%. Following some upward momentum in 2021, expectations have been levelling off since October of that year. Expectations for interest rates on mortgages in the next 12 months continued to drift up to 4.0% from their January low of 3.3%. Consumers’ perceived credit access conditions over the past 12 months tightened marginally and expectations 12 months ahead remained broadly unchanged. The share of consumers who report having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined further from 13.7% in January to 12.7% in April 2022.

Tighter credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties, relatively contained despite the war in Ukraine
Higher demand for funding secured against government bonds but lower demand for funding secured against equities
Clients’ liquidity needs resulting from variation margin requirements on their volatile commodity derivative portfolios largely met using credit lines
Overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened over the March-May 2022 review period. This tightening seems relatively contained compared with previous surveys at a time of crisis. Price and non-price terms tightened for all counterparties except hedge funds, for which non-price terms remained, on balance, unchanged. The tightening continued the trend reported for the previous four quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the previous survey. The June 2022 survey respondents expected price and non-price terms to tighten further for almost all types of counterparty over the period from June 2022 to August 2022.
Turning to securities financing transactions, survey responses gave a mixed picture regarding financing conditions. This was reflected in the net percentages of participants reporting a slightly lower maximum amount and a slightly higher maximum maturity of funding for most types of euro-denominated collateral, and in increasing rates/spreads for funding secured against most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral had either increased or remained unchanged for most types of collateral. Responses also gave a mixed picture regarding demand for funding, with a significant share of respondents reporting higher demand for funding secured against government bonds but lower demand for funding secured against equities.
In the case of non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, respondents reported that, over the March-May 2022 review period, initial margin requirements had increased for all OTC derivative types and liquidity and trading had deteriorated for most OTC derivative types. Valuation disputes had increased in volume, duration and persistence for almost all OTC derivative types over the review period, but most noticeably for credit derivatives referencing corporates and for commodity derivatives.
In view of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting volatile commodity derivative markets, special questions were included in the June 2022 survey to assess the impact of margin requirements on survey respondents’ clients as well as on survey respondents’ respective institutions. A small number of responding institutions’ clients were experiencing liquidity strains resulting from variation margin requirements on their commodity derivative portfolios, which were largely met using credit lines. Survey respondents did not report any general market shifts related to the volatile commodity derivative markets. However, more than half of respondents reported shifts from exchange-traded commodity derivatives to less collateralised market segments (e.g. non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives). Only a small number reported a shift between exchanges or products.
The June 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The June 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between March 2022 and May 2022. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 25 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 11 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Climate risk shocks could spread throughout the financial system, notably in the event of a disorderly green transition
Financial market losses from abruptly repricing climate risks could affect investment funds and insurers as well as trigger corporate defaults and credit losses for banks
Macroprudential and microprudential policies should work in tandem to mitigate systemic risk
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) today published a joint report on how climate shocks can affect the European financial system. The findings show that climate risks can quickly spread and harm companies and banks alike. The report adds further evidence on the systemic nature of climate risks and provides a foundation for a macroprudential policy response.
The report identifies several amplifiers of climate risk across the financial system. Transition risks may be magnified because of economic and financial linkages between and across banks and companies. For example, a surge in carbon prices could increase the likelihood that the default of one company leads to the default of another. While this particularly applies to high-carbon companies, it could also affect their less carbon-intensive counterparties.
Meanwhile, interdependent natural hazards – such as water stress, heat stress and wildfires – can amplify physical climate risk, as they can cluster together and exacerbate each other. Market dynamics can also magnify the financial impact of physical risks. For example, a climate shock could lead to a sudden reassessment of climate risk pricing, thereby causing fire sales, where financial institutions – especially those with overlapping portfolios – quickly sell a large number of exposed assets at the same time at distressed prices.
Scenario analysis suggests that climate risks might take shape in the financial system in a specific order. First, unforeseen climate shocks could have an abrupt impact on market prices, initially hitting the portfolios of investment funds, pension funds and insurance companies. Second, this sudden repricing could cause companies to default, resulting in losses for exposed banks. In a disorderly transition scenario, marked by an immediate and substantial increase in carbon prices, respective market losses of insurers and investment funds could potentially amount to 3% and 25% on stress-tested assets in the near term. An orderly transition towards net zero by 2050 could soften such shocks and alleviate the fallout for companies and banks, reducing the probability of corporate defaults by around 13-20% in 2050 compared with today’s policies. It would also lessen credit losses for banks.
The report assesses the scope for macroprudential policies as part of a broader policy response to address the financial impact of climate change. It presents the case for adapting existing instruments, notably systemic risk buffers or concentration thresholds. Such measures could complement efforts at the microprudential level, such as the ECB’s supervisory climate agenda including the ongoing thematic review of climate risks and the 2022 climate risk stress test.
The report builds on two previous ECB/ESRB reports on climate risk.

It is part of the ECB-wide climate agenda that details all our ongoing climate-related work, including efforts to enhance the assessment of climate risks. This work includes an update of the 2021 economy-wide climate stress test as well as the continuous monitoring of climate risk in the financial system.

HICP inflation expectations revised up across all horizons
Real GDP growth expectations revised down for the nearer term, but otherwise broadly stable
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2022, respondents revised up their inflation expectations for all horizons. For 2022, 2023 and 2024, these stand at 7.3%, 3.6% and 2.1% respectively, 1.3, 1.2 and 0.2 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. According to respondents, the upward revisions mainly reflect higher energy and food prices, but also the stronger than expected pass-through of input cost increases. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) stood at 2.2% on average, revised up by another 0.1 percentage point.
Real GDP growth expectations were revised down from the second quarter of 2022 onwards, as well as for 2023, but remained the same for 2024. Longer-term growth expectations were revised up marginally. Respondents noted that the stronger than expected outturn in the first quarter of 2022 largely offset the weaker dynamics expected for the other quarters. They report that the main factors contributing to this bleaker growth outlook include intensifying energy price pressures, the tightening of monetary policy around the world and the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of households. They noted that although the supply chain bottlenecks linked to the COVID-19 crisis have eased somewhat, they are still acting as a drag on the global economy. By contrast, fiscal measures against rising energy prices have cushioned the energy price shock to some extent, and the effects of the reopening of the economy have also played out positively.
Notwithstanding the downward revisions to expected GDP growth, unemployment rate expectations were again revised down for all horizons. Respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 6.7% in 2022 to 6.4% by 2027. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level in the history of the ECB SPF, which started in 1999."
,"Summary
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2022, HICP inflation expectations were revised up across all horizons, standing at 7.3%, 3.6% and 2.1% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.
[
1
]
According to respondents, the upward revisions mainly reflect higher energy and food prices, but also the stronger than expected pass-through of input cost increases. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were revised up by another 0.1 percentage point to stand at 2.2% on average. Expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised up across all horizons. According to respondents, these revisions mainly reflect stronger and broader indirect effects from higher energy and food prices, effects from supply chain disruptions and post-pandemic rebounds. Real GDP growth expectations were revised down for 2022 (from the second quarter onwards) and 2023 but remained unchanged for 2024. Longer-term growth expectations were revised up marginally. At the same time, the profile of the expected unemployment rate was revised down once again for all horizons by between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points. The expected profile for the future unemployment rate is relatively flat, declining from 6.7% in 2022 to 6.4% by 2027, a record low.

1 HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2022, 2023 and 2024
SPF respondents revised up their inflation expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024. These stand at 7.3%, 3.6% and 2.1% respectively, 1.3, 1.2 and 0.2 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round (see Chart 1). Compared with the June 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, inflation expectations in this SPF round were higher by 0.5 percentage points for 2022 and by 0.1 percentage point for 2023, but remained the same for 2024 (see Table 1).
Chart 1
Inflation expectations: overall HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco
(annual percentage changes)
Regarding the near-term outlook, respondents cited energy and food prices as the main factors behind their upward revisions to the 2022 and 2023 inflation expectations. In addition to the direct impact on consumer prices of food and energy, with gas mentioned more often than oil, respondents also noted that indirect effects working through the production chain were behind the higher expectations for HICP inflation excluding food and energy. In the previous round, respondents generally did not consider underlying price pressures to have increased, as they had revised down their growth projections and only saw a limited impact of higher inflation on their wage expectations. In contrast, respondents in this round noted that (i) indirect effects were broader and more intense than expected, (ii) they considered domestic price pressures to have generally increased as price increases broadened across sectors and (iii) high inflation was likely to have an impact on wages. The weaker euro (particularly versus the dollar) and tight labour markets were also cited as upward factors for inflation expectations. At the same time, some respondents noted that some of the global value chain disruptions and the prices of some (primarily) non-energy, non-food commodities, such as metals and other industrial raw materials, were showing tentative signs of peaking or even easing.
Respondents were asked to elaborate on their recent inflation forecast errors and on when they thought HICP/HICPX inflation would peak.
[

]
Respondents cited the following as the main factors behind recent forecast errors: (i) energy price increases, (ii) food prices, which were linked to energy prices and to the Ukraine conflict, (iii) a broader and more intense pass-through of indirect effects from energy prices, (iv) supply side issues in global value chains, which was linked to the pandemic generally, China’s zero-coronavirus (COVID-19) policy and the war in Ukraine, and (v) rebounds in certain segments previously impacted by the pandemic, particularly services. Generally, they felt these factors would persist and perhaps intensify. On the possible timing of their forecasted “peak” in inflation, it should be (noted that every respondent expected inflation in 2023, 2024 and 2027 to be lower than in 2022). A majority (14 out of 19 for headline inflation and five out of seven for HICPX) felt that the peak was yet to come. The modal answer for both headline HICP inflation (10 out of 19 responses) and HICPX inflation (three out of seven responses) was September 2022 (see Chart 2).

(percentage of respondents)
Notes: The label (x;y) indicates number of respondents for HICP and HICPX respectively. As some respondents specified a range of months, percentages may sum to more than 100%.
For the shorter and medium-term horizons, quantitative indicators of uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook increased to record levels and the balance of risks was assessed to be clearly on the upside.
[
3
]
Quantitative indicators of uncertainty for inflation derived from the reported probability distributions increased to historically high levels. The high level of “aggregate uncertainty” is owing to elevated “disagreement” among forecasters about their point forecasts combined with a high average level of “individual uncertainty” reflected in the average width of the individual probability distributions. The aggregate probability distributions for the calendar years from 2022 to 2024 are presented in Chart 3. The quantitative balance of risk indicator (calculated as the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution minus the average reported point expectation) for shorter horizons was generally to the upside. In their qualitative remarks, respondents reported risks of further energy and food price increases as well as some pass-through that was even stronger than assumed. At the same time, some respondents cited downside risks in the form of an economic slowdown triggered either by the impact of high inflation on real disposable incomes or by the tightening of monetary policy.
SPF expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised up for all horizons. HICPX expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024 stood at 3.6%, 2.9% and 2.3% respectively, representing upward revisions of 0.7 percentage points for 2022, 0.6 percentage points for 2023 and 0.3 percentage points for 2024. Respondents indicated that the upward revisions reflect a more intense and broader pass-through of higher energy and food prices and of global supply chain disruptions. They also considered that the combination of higher inflation and tight labour market conditions would result in higher wage increases. A number of respondents noted that inflationary pressure was no longer just “external” and that domestic price pressures were also starting to rise. The SPF forecasts for HICPX in 2022 and 2023 were higher than those from the June 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections by 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points respectively, but remained the same for 2024 (see Table 1).
Chart 3
Aggregate probability distributions for expected inflation in 2022, 2023 and 2024
(x-axis: HICP inflation expectations, annual percentage changes; y-axis: probability, percentages)
Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This Chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in 2022, 2023 and 2024. To minimise the number of bins in the questionnaire, the upper bin for inflation outcomes was set to ? 5.0%. *The highest bin used in the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2022 rounds was ?4.0%. The fact that this would lead to most probability being assigned to the upper bin for 2022 was flagged to respondents when sending out the questionnaire.
2 Longer-term inflation expectations revised up further
Longer-term inflation expectations further increased. Expectations for 2027 averaged 2.2%, a further upward revision from 2.1% in the previous round. With a trimmed mean, where the highest response and the two lowest responses are removed, the increase would be to 2.1% from 2.0%. The median point expectation was unchanged at 2.0%. The estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution also increased to 2.1% from 2.0% (see Chart 4). Having remained in the narrow range (1.64%-1.69%) in the SPF rounds between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021, longer-term inflation expectations have moved up noticeably since the third quarter of 2021. In the most recent round (third quarter of 2022), considering a balanced panel of those who also replied in the second quarter of 2022 round, more respondents revised their longer-term inflation expectations upwards than downwards.
[

]
The distribution of individual point forecasts changed considerably in the previous four rounds, when compared with rounds from the first quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2021. However, in this round it remained broadly unchanged (see Chart 5). The mode of the distribution was again clearly at 2.0%. Similar to the previous round, there was a number of respondents who reported longer-term inflation expectations above 2.5% (8, or 17%, in the third quarter of 2022 compared with 5, or 11%, in the second quarter of 2022 round).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This Chart shows the spread of point forecast responses. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in the third quarter of 2022 round and to 2026 in the previous rounds shown.
Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations increased, and the balance of risks tilted to the upside for the first time since the global financial crisis. The sharp increase in “aggregate uncertainty” – the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution (see Chart 6) – was primarily due to increased “disagreement” resulting from a strong outlier, while “individual uncertainty”, as measured by the average width of the individual probability distributions, increased slightly further to a historically high level. The balance of risk indicator turned positive for the first time since 2009. The probability associated with longer-term inflation being in the range 1.5%-2.5% decreased slightly to 47% (from 49%), with a 33% (from 29%) probability above this range (i.e. >2.5%) and a 20% (from 22%) probability below this range (i.e. <1.5%).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This Chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in the longer term. *The highest bin used in the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2022 rounds was ?4.0. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in the third quarter of 2022 round and to 2026 in the previous rounds shown.
The longer-term expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) increased to 2.2%, up from 1.9% in the previous round. While the scale of the increase is due to rounding and to a large outlier, excluding this outlier would still have resulted in an increase from 1.9% to 2.0%. There was thus an upward revision on average when compared with the previous round, as was the case with headline HICP expectations. The median longer-term point expectation for HICPX also increased to 2.0%, from 1.9%. Of the 24 respondents who provided longer-term HICPX expectations in both the third quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2022 rounds, 11 revised them up, 11 kept them unchanged and two revised them down. The evolution of longer-term expectations for HICP and HICPX inflation has been broadly similar for the period of available data since the fourth quarter of 2016, with a level difference of around 0.1 percentage point on average, but this difference has disappeared in this round. This feature also holds when controlling for outliers.
3 Real GDP growth expectations revised down for the near term, but broadly stable otherwise
GDP growth expectations in the third quarter of 2022 survey round stood at 2.8% for 2022, 1.5% for 2023 and 1.8% for 2024 (see Chart 7). Compared with the previous round, these imply downward revisions of 0.1 percentage point for 2022 and 0.8 percentage points for 2023, and no change for 2024. For the 2022 annual growth rate expectation, respondents noted that the stronger than expected outturn in the first quarter largely offset the weaker dynamics expected for the other quarters, and these lower dynamics would then mainly show in carry-over to 2023. Respondents report that the main factors contributing to this bleaker growth outlook include intensifying energy price pressures, the tightening of monetary policy around the world and inflation harming households’ purchasing power, an effect which is compounded by the foreseen persistence and broadening of inflationary pressures. Respondents also noted that despite pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks having eased somewhat, they are still acting as a drag on the global economy. By contrast, fiscal measures against rising energy prices have cushioned the energy price shock to some extent, and the effects of the reopening of the economy also played out positively. Downward risks remained broadly the same. In addition to risks relating to the duration and effects of the war in Ukraine, respondents highlighted concerns about a possible halting of energy supplies and the need to impose rationing on energy use during the winter. Additional factors that were referenced included fears of a new COVID-19 outbreak, faster monetary tightening and persistent supply chain disruptions. Respondents considered the perspective of a quick resolution to the war in Ukraine, something cited as a potential upside risk in the previous round, to now be fading, reducing possible upward risks. Longer-term growth expectations (which refer to 2027) were marginally higher at 1.5%, up by 0.1 percentage point.

Expectations for real GDP growth
(annual percentage changes)
Respondents were again asked to provide the profile of their short-term GDP outlook (from the second quarter of 2022 until the first quarter of 2023).
[
5
]
Actual quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for the first quarter of 2022 was 0.6%, substantially more than the forecast of 0.2% in the previous SPF round. In this round, forecasters expected quarter-on-quarter growth between the second quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 to remain modest at around 0.2% on average (ranging from 0.1% to 0.3%). This is about 0.4 percentage points lower per quarter than forecast in the previous round for the second quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Chart 8). Of the 44 forecasters who provided a forecasted quarterly growth profile, 19 (or 43.2%) see at least one quarter of negative growth between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023 (eight for the second quarter, four for the third quarter, 14 for the fourth quarter and ten for the first quarter of 2023). 11 (or 25%) forecast a “technical recession” – two consecutive quarters of negative growth– over the period. SPF forecasts for the second quarter of 2022 were broadly similar to those of the June 2022 Eurosystem staff Macroeconomic Projection Exercise, but were more pessimistic for the following three quarters (by about 0.3 percentage points per quarter).

(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes)
Notes: Grey area indicates one standard deviation (of individual expectations) around average SPF expectation.
Although real GDP returned to above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2021, the downward revisions to expected growth in 2022 and 2023 have further delayed its expected return to the pre-pandemic profile (see Chart 9). Compared with the profile expected in the first quarter of 2022 round (conducted in early January, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), the level of GDP has been revised down by about 2%. Expected GDP levels after 2023 are also lower than forecast in the June 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections (by about 0.6% in 2024).
Chart 9
Forecast profile of real GDP level
(2019 = 100)
Note: Growth expectations for years not surveyed have been interpolated linearly.
Quantitative measures of uncertainty inched up this round, while the two-year-ahead balance of risks deteriorated dramatically, close to its lowest historical levels (see Chart 10 and Chart 11). The only other occasions when the balance of risks around the two-year-ahead growth expectation has been lower was at the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020 and after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Aggregate uncertainty increased at the longer-term horizons, and risks were tilted even more to the upside this round. Although uncertainty was elevated by historical standards, it was still considerably lower than at its peak in the second and third quarters of 2020. The deterioration in the balance of risks was attributed in large part to fears of a halt in Russian gas supplies. Further deteriorations in sentiment as well as lower real incomes owing to persistent inflation are also among the fears registered.

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This Chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of real GDP growth outcomes in the longer term. Longer-term expectations refer to 2027 in third quarter of 2022 round and to 2026 in the previous rounds shown.
4 Unemployment rate expectations revised down again for all horizons
The average point forecasts for the unemployment rate in the third quarter of 2022 round were 6.7%, 6.7% and 6.6% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. The expectation for 2027 was 6.4%, the lowest rate ever recorded for long-term unemployment expectations. As in the previous round, the expected downward sloping trajectory of the unemployment rate remains, but is somewhat flatter, as it starts from a lower level in 2022 (see Chart 12). Respondents explained that the smaller downward revisions beyond 2022 were due to the impact of the lower expected levels of economic activity. High inflation, which is reducing real disposable incomes and consumption as well as feeding into wages, was mentioned as the main upward risk for unemployment. By contrast, robust labour markets, demographic factors and labour shortages in certain sectors were frequently mentioned as downward risks. Unlike the previous round, the war in Ukraine and migration were not explicitly mentioned as factors affecting the unemployment rate forecasts.

Expectations for the unemployment rate
(percentages of the labour force)
Uncertainty around expectations for the unemployment rate increased slightly for all horizons, remaining at relatively high levels, and the balance of risks is to the upside for all horizons. On balance, the distributions are losing the marginally positive skewness seen in previous rounds and are now showing a greater degree of symmetry for all horizons (see Chart 13 and Chart 14). The balance of risk indicator for longer-term expectations remained positive, as the mean of the aggregated probability distribution (at 6.6%) was slightly higher than the average point forecast (6.4%).

5 Expectations for other variables
Forecasters expected: the ECB’s key main refinancing operations (MRO) interest rate to increase steadily from 0.5% in the third quarter of 2022 to 1.3% in the first quarter of 2023 and reach an average of 1.8% in 2024; the euro to marginally appreciate against the dollar from 1.06 in 2022 to 1.12 in 2024; oil prices to progressively decrease to levels around USD 89 per barrel until 2024; and nominal wage growth to increase at a rate higher than 3% until 2024 but to moderate to below 3% in the long-term.
The median (and majority) expectation was for the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to increase steadily from 0.5% in the third quarter 2022 to 1.3% the first quarter of 2023. Interest rates are expected to stand at an average level of 1.5% (up from 0.6%) in 2023 and reach 1.8% (up from 1.0%) by 2024 (see Chart 15a). Concerning the 2023 average, almost 90% of the replies reported values below 2%, and around 10% of respondents reported values above 2.5%. Similarly, 80% of respondents expected interest rates to be, on average, below 2% in 2024 and about 15% to be above 2.5%.
The expected average USD/EUR exchange rate was revised downward over all horizons and it is expected to stand at around 1.06 in 2022, to then marginally increase at a constant pace up to 1.12 by 2024 (see Chart 15b).
Compared with the previous round, the level of US dollar-denominated oil prices (per barrel) was revised upwards. The revisions were about USD 9 and USD 6 per barrel for 2022 and 2023, respectively. This resulted in a steeper downward trajectory from about USD 113 per barrel in the second quarter of 2022 to around USD 89 per barrel in 2024 (see Chart 15c). Given the expected USD/EUR exchange rate, the implied revisions to the profile for the oil price in euro terms are somehow higher than those in US dollar terms – EUR 12 in 2022 and EUR 9 in 2023.
Expectations for the annual growth in compensation per employee were revised up by 0.6-0.7 percentage points over all horizons (see Chart 15d). Although expectations for 2027 were recorded to stand at about 3.0%, this figure decreases to an annual growth rate of 2.6% when removing a strong outlier.

The Governing Council today approved the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI). The Governing Council assessed that the establishment of the TPI is necessary to support the effective transmission of monetary policy. In particular, as the Governing Council continues normalising monetary policy, the TPI will ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. The singleness of the Governing Council’s monetary policy is a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate.
The TPI will be an addition to our toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. By safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the TPI will allow the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
Subject to fulfilling established criteria, the Eurosystem will be able to make secondary market purchases of securities issued in jurisdictions experiencing a deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals, to counter risks to the transmission mechanism to the extent necessary. The scale of TPI purchases would depend on the severity of the risks facing monetary policy transmission. Purchases are not restricted ex ante.
Purchase parameters
TPI purchases would be focused on public sector securities (marketable debt securities issued by central and regional governments as well as agencies, as defined by the ECB) with a remaining maturity of between one and ten years. Purchases of private sector securities could be considered, if appropriate.
Eligibility
The Governing Council will consider a cumulative list of criteria to assess whether the jurisdictions in which the Eurosystem may conduct purchases under the TPI pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. These criteria will be an input into the Governing Council’s decision-making and will be dynamically adjusted to the unfolding risks and conditions to be addressed.
In particular, the criteria include: (1) compliance with the EU fiscal framework: not being subject to an excessive deficit procedure (EDP), or not being assessed as having failed to take effective action in response to an EU Council recommendation under Article 126(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU); (2) absence of severe macroeconomic imbalances: not being subject to an excessive imbalance procedure (EIP) or not being assessed as having failed to take the recommended corrective action related to an EU Council recommendation under Article 121(4) TFEU; (3) fiscal sustainability: in ascertaining that the trajectory of public debt is sustainable, the Governing Council will take into account, where available, the debt sustainability analyses by the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism, the International Monetary Fund and other institutions, together with the ECB’s internal analysis; (4) sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies: complying with the commitments submitted in the recovery and resilience plans for the Recovery and Resilience Facility and with the European Commission’s country-specific recommendations in the fiscal sphere under the European Semester.
Activation
A decision by the Governing Council to activate the TPI will be based on a comprehensive assessment of market and transmission indicators, an evaluation of the eligibility criteria and a judgement that the activation of purchases under the TPI is proportionate to the achievement of the ECB’s primary objective.
Purchases would be terminated either upon a durable improvement in transmission, or based on an assessment that persistent tensions are due to country fundamentals.
Creditor treatment
The Eurosystem accepts the same (pari passu) treatment as private or other creditors with respect to bonds issued by euro area governments and purchased by the Eurosystem under the TPI, in accordance with the terms of such bonds.
Relation to the monetary policy stance
In order to avoid potential interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance, should the TPI be activated, the Governing Council will address the implications of the TPI purchases for the scale of the aggregate Eurosystem monetary policy debt security portfolio and the amount of excess liquidity. Purchases under the TPI would be conducted such that they cause no persistent impact on the overall Eurosystem balance sheet and hence on the monetary policy stance.
PEPP reinvestment flexibility
PEPP reinvestment flexibility will continue to be the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT)
The OMT is part of the Eurosystem’s toolkit. The Governing Council retains discretion to conduct the OMT for countries that fulfil the requisite criteria for the OMT.

Today, in line with the Governing Council’s strong commitment to its price stability mandate, the Governing Council took further key steps to make sure inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term. The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and approved the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI).
The Governing Council judged that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting. This decision is based on the Governing Council’s updated assessment of inflation risks and the reinforced support provided by the TPI for the effective transmission of monetary policy. It will support the return of inflation to the Governing Council’s medium-term target by strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations and by ensuring that demand conditions adjust to deliver its inflation target in the medium term.
At the Governing Council’s upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. The frontloading today of the exit from negative interest rates allows the Governing Council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions. The Governing Council’s future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help to deliver on its 2% inflation target over the medium term. In the context of its policy normalisation, the Governing Council will evaluate options for remunerating excess liquidity holdings.

Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 0.50%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively, with effect from 27 July 2022.

Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio are being reinvested flexibly, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.

The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The Governing Council’s new TPI will safeguard the smooth transmission of its monetary policy stance throughout the euro area.

,"Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Wednesday and Thursday, 20-21 July 2022
25 August 2022
1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments, noting that the narrative had shifted since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting in early June 2022. Weaker than expected incoming data on the global economy and concerns about disruptions to gas supplies, in combination with further higher than expected inflation outcomes, had turned investors’ focus towards a possible “stagflationary” scenario. In this environment, the volatility of short-term interest rate expectations stood at a historical high. The EUR/USD exchange rate remained under pressure. The sell-off of risk assets had continued as investors were still not attracted by cheaper valuations.
Ms Schnabel then turned to the key drivers of the shift in investor sentiment from concerns about inflation to concerns about stagflation. Surprises in economic data releases had recently been negative across the global economy. In the United States, fears of a recession had, at least temporarily, weighed on natural gas prices, and on commodity prices more generally. By contrast, despite the waning growth momentum, gas prices had continued to increase in Europe owing to the domestic gas supply shock.
Daily movements in expectations about short-term interest rates had been at historical highs lately, reflecting the uncertainty that investors were facing regarding the monetary policy implications of incoming information. Looking through this volatility, investors expected the ECB to speed up policy normalisation over the near term, relative to expectations at the time of the June 2022 Governing Council meeting, despite increasing risks of slowing growth momentum. Compared with June 2022, the overnight index swap (OIS) forward curve had steepened at the front end. Survey participants had now, by and large, converged to the market’s view regarding a swift tightening of the key ECB policy rates.
Measures of inflation compensation led to three key observations. First, the very front end of the inflation-linked swap forward curve had increased notably since the June monetary policy meeting, reflecting in particular the supply-side-driven sharp increase in European gas prices. Second, medium-term inflation expectations had peaked around the Governing Council’s April meeting and had since gradually shifted lower, partly owing to a reappraisal of expectations about the Governing Council’s monetary policy intentions. Forward inflation swap rates were now converging towards 2% from above that level in 2024 and fluctuated around 2% over the following years. Third, despite the decline in inflation compensation, tail risks to inflation and the risk of an unanchoring of longer-term compensation had not moderated. The probability that markets assigned to high inflation outcomes of above 4% over a five-year horizon five years ahead had risen steadily since the start of the year. The probability currently stood at 15%, the highest level since 2013. According to the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters, longer-term inflation expectations had been revised upwards to stand on average at 2.2%. This was consistent with stickier long-term inflation compensation in markets.
The repricing of inflation compensation had been the key factor driving the recent decline in nominal long-term sovereign bond yields. The ten-year real rate – i.e. adjusted for inflation – had increased further since the June monetary policy meeting. However, from a historical perspective, both short and long-term euro area real sovereign bond yields remained low.
Against the background of the ECB’s monetary policy normalisation path embedded in market expectations, Ms Schnabel noted that a substantial tightening of financial conditions was ongoing in the euro area. However, unlike in some other major currency areas, the rate expectations embedded in financial market prices had yet to be validated by the ECB through actual decisions. The asset price affected most by the divergence between monetary policies across major currency areas was the euro exchange rate. Around half of the 10% depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar since the start of the year could be attributed to the divergence in monetary policies. The ad hoc Governing Council meeting on 15 June 2022 might have contributed to mitigating further downward pressures on the euro exchange rate.
As regards sovereign bond spreads, the initial orderly increase since the beginning of the year had accelerated after the June 2022 Governing Council meeting, as concerns about the extent of monetary policy tightening that would be required to restore price stability had intensified. The ECB’s announcement after the ad hoc Governing Council meeting that it would accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument had halted or reversed adverse dynamics in some euro area sovereign bond markets.
Market-based funding costs for banks had increased notably since the start of the year on the back of the rise in the risk-free rate and the broad-based increase in risk premia. Yet, in contrast to previous episodes of heightened volatility in sovereign bond markets, there had so far been no visible differentiation between banks across euro area jurisdictions. The same observation could be made for the market-based financing costs of non-financial corporations: in tandem with rates on other risk assets, corporate bond yields had surged over the past few months on the back of rising real yields and, lately, the deterioration in investor sentiment.
Ms Schnabel then noted that the rise in real rates and the weakening in investor sentiment had also had an impact on equity prices. Since the Governing Council’s meeting in early June 2022, euro area stock markets had declined further, falling by around 7%, driven by an increase in the equity risk premium, higher discount rates and weakening longer-term earnings growth expectations, while near-term earnings forecasts had remained resilient.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Mr Lane then went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area. Starting with the global picture, compared with the level in December 2019, global trade was well above its pre-pandemic level, but there had been a decline in the first few months of this year and high-frequency data on global trade, available until mid-July, showed that this decline was accelerating. Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for the manufacturing sector in the second quarter showed a sharp drop in output across advanced economies. The PMI for services showed a levelling-off in May and June, after the strong reading for April.
Comparing the current level of the EUR/USD exchange rate with the level at the end of 2020, when it had reached a peak, there had been a sustained but fairly gentle depreciation of the euro. More recently the bilateral exchange rate had seen a more pronounced drop. Oil prices had declined since the June Governing Council meeting and the futures curve extended this decline until 2024, while the gas price had increased markedly. Other commodity prices had moderated.
Turning to the euro area economy, various indicators for the manufacturing sector showed a sharp slowdown, with the PMI new export orders index falling below the 50 threshold in June. By contrast, services remained on an upward trend thanks to the reopening of the economy, although the latest data pointed to some moderation. Supply bottlenecks, as measured by the PMI indicator of suppliers’ delivery times, had seen a visible improvement, having halved compared with their worst level observed last autumn. However, this was largely due to a significant moderation in demand rather than a genuine improvement in supply.
Alongside the deterioration in the short-term GDP outlook, the terms of trade shock continued to severely hit the real income and purchasing power of households. The goods trade balance had stabilised in May compared with April, which was partly due to the fact that energy consumption was moderating in Europe. However, compared with spending about 1% of GDP on energy imports at the start of 2021, the euro area was now spending about 4% of GDP.
Turning to domestic demand, private consumption had moderated significantly since the end of last year. Consumers were buying fewer retail goods and were expecting to make fewer major purchases. At the same time, consumers were increasing their spending on services. For housing investment, concerns related to shortages of materials and labour had declined somewhat in recent months, reflecting lower than expected construction activity. However, concerns related to financing conditions had become more prominent and, overall, the outlook for the housing sector was for a cooling-down. Regarding business investment, capital goods production pointed to continued weakness.
With regard to the labour market, the unemployment rate had declined in May to a record low of 6.6%. As labour force participation was recovering in the euro area, the improvement in the unemployment figure reflected job creation. However, the latest PMI data were indicating a loss of momentum. Changes in the sectoral composition of employment could help explain why the labour market remained strong, driven by the reopening of the recreation sector and other labour-intensive activities, which had seen a big drop during the pandemic.
Turning to the latest inflation developments, inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had increased further in June, to stand at 8.6%. Energy inflation, which accounted for about 10% of the HICP basket, had contributed about half of the overall increase and had remained exceptionally high in June at around 42%. This reflected continued high increases in gas, oil and electricity commodity and wholesale prices. A second big contributor continued to be food, which accounted for about 20% of the HICP basket. Non-energy industrial goods prices had also continued to increase in June, with durable goods being strongly affected by supply bottlenecks and most recently by pipeline pressures – i.e. the pass-through of earlier increases in prices in the production chain. Services inflation had seen a small decline in June, which was due to the reduction in public transportation prices in Germany from 1 June to 31 August.
Indicators of underlying inflation continued to rise. A new index constructed by ECB staff provided a measure of domestic inflation, by including prices of all items with a low import content. This measure was currently above 3%, at the bottom of the range of indicators for underlying inflation. The expectation that all the indicators of underlying inflation would revert to 2% was based on the assumption that the energy shock and supply bottlenecks would gradually disappear. The momentum in terms of the month-on-month change in underlying inflation indicators had been roughly stable. However, it was stable at a rate well above levels consistent with 2% inflation. The question remained as to whether this would be a temporary adjustment or more persistent.
Turning to wages, negotiated wages had continued to grow at a modest rate over the last few months. The experimental ECB wage tracker, which included some of the largest euro area countries, indicated that the wage increases agreed in the first quarter of 2022 implied annual wage growth of around 3% this year, before falling back to around 2.5% next year. The most recent wage agreements signed in the second quarter showed a pick-up in wage growth to around 3.5% both this year and next year. This implied that new agreements were consistent with inflation remaining significantly higher for longer, but also that the wage adjustment was far from catching up 100% with inflation.
Regarding profit margins, the latest ECB Corporate Telephone Survey gave a mixed picture between those firms able to increase margins and those with decreasing margins, reflecting differences in their capacity to pass on the large increases in input costs. The pass-through potential was higher for intermediate firms selling to other businesses than for those selling directly to consumers.
With respect to inflation expectations, the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters indicated that the mean longer-term inflation forecast had risen slightly, while the mode, i.e. the most frequent answer given by participants, remained at 2%. There was still a part of the distribution of responses that was below 2%, but in the course of this year there had been an increase in the share of participants who thought inflation would remain above 2.5%, which now amounted to nearly 20% of the respondents. Market-based measures of inflation compensation were consistent with an acute episode of high inflation but implied a return to 2% around mid-2024.
Turning to financial and monetary developments, Mr Lane first noted that the respondents in the July Survey of Monetary Analysts had shifted up and steepened the path for the expected deposit facility rate, relative to the survey round in June, and had changed their assessment of the stance at the end of the interest rate hiking cycle. Mr Lane also reported that banks had seen a big increase in the cost of market funding since the start of the year and their composite funding costs had been creeping up even without any increase in interest rates paid on bank deposits. Firms too had seen a marked increase in the cost of market-based financing and the costs of borrowing from banks had also edged up. Real borrowing rates, while remaining in negative territory, had also crept up in the period to May. The cost of bank borrowing for households for house purchase had continued to increase strongly, reflecting rising long-term market interest rates. When adjusting for inflation, real rates had also started to increase, while remaining in negative territory.
The July 2022 bank lending survey showed that banks had considerably tightened their credit standards for both firms and households in the second quarter of 2022. Behind this tightening was a reduction in risk tolerance and an increase in risk perception, related to the deteriorating economic outlook.
Bank lending to firms remained robust. Since the end of 2021 firms had been tapping the bond market to a lesser extent and instead had mainly been using bank financing. The July bank lending survey indicated that firms’ demand for bank loans was being driven by the need to finance working capital and inventories rather than new investment. Lending flows to households remained strong. However, the July bank lending survey indicated a drop in demand for housing loans in the second quarter and in the following months.
Money growth had moderated significantly from its peak and its short-term dynamics were now below the long-term average. This reflected the fact that the ECB had stopped its net asset purchases, as well as lower firm deposits with banks.
Regarding the role of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in a currency union, Mr Lane recalled that the smooth transmission of the single monetary policy across all euro area jurisdictions was a prerequisite to deliver on the ECB’s price stability mandate. He explained that in a decentralised currency union the smooth transmission of monetary policy did not mean that the level of borrowing costs had to be the same across all jurisdictions in the union. Differences in local financing conditions could legitimately arise owing to, among other things, country-specific economic factors. However, the monetary policy impulses that the Governing Council sent should be transmitted smoothly and not give rise to disproportionate reactions in some jurisdictions that were divorced from fundamental factors in those regions. A fundamentally unjustified reaction of local financing conditions to expected or actual changes in the monetary policy stance would induce distortions that would ultimately undermine the singleness of the ECB’s monetary policy and its ability to deliver on its Treaty mandate.
In particular, a breakdown in the relation between sovereign yields and fundamentals, with bond markets becoming fragmented along national borders, might lead to excessive divergences in financing conditions across the euro area which, if left unchecked, could result in persistent impairments in the transmission mechanism. Episodes of acute and unwarranted divergences in financing conditions across countries could arise in response to a wide range of different shocks and in the face of inflation that was too low or too high.
Mr Lane stressed that the ongoing normalisation of the ECB’s monetary policy stance could be a trigger for fragmentation in bond markets, with adverse consequences for all euro area countries. Volatility and upward shifts in the risk-free yield curve meant that the duration risk for private investors increased, which tested their capacity to hold different types of risk and put upward pressure on sovereign spreads in vulnerable jurisdictions. This could lead to a tightening of financing conditions in these countries – possibly over and above what was appropriate to address excess inflation. A symmetric distortion in the opposite direction could emerge in less vulnerable countries, where capital inflows originating from the vulnerable countries could compress yields below the levels necessary to stabilise inflation at the target over the medium term.
In all these cases, a currency union was particularly susceptible to the risk that fragmentation events might degenerate into self-fulfilling debt crises. While there was typically a maximum level of interest rates at or below which national government debt was sustainable, the interest rates at which euro area countries could refinance debt could spiral upwards in a self-fulfilling manner to levels where debt dynamics became unstable and ultimately unsustainable. Such self-perpetuating mechanisms gave rise to multiple equilibria. In particular, even a fundamentally sound sovereign could be brought to the brink of default owing to a self-fulfilling dynamic involving market participants demanding higher risk premia based on a fear that the market might become illiquid. Announcing that the Governing Council was prepared to intervene in the bond market to lean against market movements not justified by fundamentals could therefore coordinate creditors’ expectations at a stable equilibrium in which a crisis was avoided.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
Mr Lane therefore proposed that the Governing Council should at the present meeting approve a new Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), as put forward by the Executive Board, to safeguard monetary policy transmission throughout the euro area and the singleness of monetary policy – a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its mandate. The TPI would be an addition to the ECB’s toolkit and could be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that posed a serious threat to the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. By safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the TPI would allow the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. Subject to fulfilling established criteria, the Eurosystem would be able to make secondary market purchases of securities issued in jurisdictions experiencing a deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals. This would enable the Eurosystem to counter risks to the transmission mechanism to the extent necessary. The scale of TPI purchases would depend on the severity of the risks facing policy transmission. Purchases would not be restricted ex ante.
The TPI was a monetary policy tool to address a wide variety of shocks that could lead to fragmentation and ultimately to transmission impairments. The TPI’s specific design features, as well as the safeguards for complying with the monetary financing prohibition and the principle of proportionality, would be decided on by the Governing Council in the light of the specific shocks that needed to be addressed in any given situation. At present the TPI was necessary – and specifically designed – to minimise threats to transmission arising from the normalisation of interest rates that was appropriate in the current environment of high inflation and significant upside risks, to ensure that inflation stabilised at the ECB’s target over the medium term.
There were two elements to the effectiveness of the TPI. First, its announcement should act as a stabilising force. Second, if considered necessary by the Governing Council, its activation at any point in time would allow an active response to an emerging threat to the transmission mechanism. To assess whether announcing the TPI at the present meeting was proportionate, three conditions should be met: first, the new tool needed to be effective in pursuing the intermediate objective of protecting the transmission mechanism as a precondition for attaining the ECB’s primary objective; second, it should be efficient in the sense that its intermediate objective could not be achieved with an alternative measure having less intrusive effects on other areas of economic life; and, third, the new tool should be cost-efficient, that is, its benefits in achieving the protection of the transmission mechanism should outweigh its potentially adverse side effects, including any conflict with the maintenance of the monetary policy stance appropriate to achieving the primary objective and any risks that the new tool might unduly interfere with economic policy.
In making this assessment, the Governing Council relied on a thorough exercise that had been carried out by Eurosystem committees and ECB staff over the past few months. The outcome of that exercise demonstrated that, first, in its current design, the TPI was an effective instrument particularly suited to accompanying the announcement of further normalisation steps, as it could prevent impairments in transmission. Second, the announcement of the TPI, which did not imply its immediate activation, was an efficient way to preserve the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy stance to an extent that could not be achieved with other instruments available to the Eurosystem, given their specific design features and purpose. Third, potential side effects as a result of a TPI announcement did not outweigh the benefits of announcing the instrument to mitigate the risk of fragmentation during the normalisation and tightening of monetary policy in the current highly uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. This was particularly true in view of the specific design features and safeguards of the TPI, which also ensured that any potential interference with the monetary policy stance and other policies would be avoided. This included the fact that, being designed to enable a normalisation of the policy rates in view of the current high level of inflation, the TPI would also mitigate the risk of a weakening of the impetus for sound fiscal policies in the euro area.
In accordance with the governance of the TPI, the Governing Council would only activate it after assessing that tangible risks to policy transmission existed at the time of activation; that adequate safeguards were in place at that time to ensure that the obligations and principles contained in EU law were respected; and after conducting a comprehensive proportionality assessment to establish that activation was proportionate to the price stability mandate of the ECB. TPI purchases would be terminated either to reflect a durable improvement in transmission or based on an assessment that persistent tensions were due to country fundamentals.
Summing up the assessment of the economy and the outlook for price stability, Mr Lane remarked that economic activity was slowing but was still benefiting from the reopening of the economy. Risks to the growth outlook remained tilted to the downside. Russia’s war in Ukraine remained a source of significant downside risk, especially if energy supplies from Russia were to be disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing for euro area firms and households. The war could also further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side constraints, while energy and food prices could remain persistently higher than expected. A faster deceleration in global growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook. Purely mechanical updates of the June projections saw high downside risks to GDP growth in the third quarter.
Inflation had increased further, from 8.1% in May to 8.6% in June. Overall, inflationary pressures had broadened and intensified, as signalled by an increase in a range of indicators of underlying inflation. Inflation was expected to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures from energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain. The depreciation of the euro was also a source of higher inflation. Looking further ahead, in the absence of new disruptions, energy costs were expected to stabilise and supply bottlenecks to ease. Together with the ongoing policy normalisation, this should support the return of inflation to the ECB’s target.
Developments in measures of inflation expectations were mixed. While there had been limited upward revisions in survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, these remained close to 2%. By contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensation had eased appreciably of late: forward inflation-linked swap rates had already priced in a return of inflation to 2% from above that level over the course of 2024. Overall, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at around 2%, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring.
The risks to the inflation outlook continued to be on the upside and had intensified, particularly in the short term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would ease pressures on prices.
Market interest rates had been exceptionally volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopolitical uncertainty. In addition, the dispersion across sovereign bond yields had remained elevated and global risk asset markets had recorded further declines. Bank funding costs had risen in the past few months, which had increasingly fed into higher bank lending rates, in particular for households. While the volume of bank lending to households remained strong, it was expected to decline in view of lower demand. Lending to firms had also been robust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding created a continued need for credit from banks. At the same time, the demand for loans to finance investment had declined. On balance, financial conditions in the euro area had tightened.
Against this backdrop, Mr Lane proposed to progress further along the path of policy normalisation to make sure that inflation returned to the 2% target over the medium term. In addition to the approval of the TPI, he proposed raising the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. While this increment was larger than the step that had been signalled at the June meeting, a bigger first step in the ECB’s policy rate normalisation path was appropriate. This was based on the updated assessment of inflation risks and taking into account the reinforced support that would be provided by the TPI for the effective transmission of monetary policy. An increment of this magnitude would support the return of inflation to the ECB’s medium-term target by strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations and by ensuring that demand conditions adjusted to deliver the ECB’s inflation target in the medium term.
Mr Lane remarked that further normalisation of interest rates would be appropriate at forthcoming meetings. The frontloading of the exit from negative interest rates at the current meeting would allow the Governing Council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions. The future policy path would be data-dependent and guided by the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation target of 2%. In the context of the policy normalisation, the Governing Council should evaluate options for remunerating excess liquidity holdings at one of its forthcoming meetings.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
With regard to the economic analysis, members broadly agreed with the assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area and the risks to the outlook provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation continued to be undesirably high and was expected to remain above target for some time. The latest data indicated a slowdown in economic growth, clouding the outlook for the second half of 2022 and beyond. At the same time, while risks to growth were on the downside – related in particular to the uncertainty about the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine – the slowdown was being cushioned by a number of supportive factors. Risks to the inflation outlook were on the upside and had intensified, especially for the short term. They were also spreading more broadly.
As regards the external environment, the slowdown in global trade observed in the first quarter of 2022 was worsening, reflecting developments in both advanced and emerging market economies. Concerns were expressed about a deteriorating outlook for the United States and the United Kingdom. It was also observed that China would probably not be able to play its past role as the engine of global growth, as its economy was slowing down.
Members widely noted that the depreciation of the euro constituted an important change in the external environment and implied greater inflationary pressures for the euro area, in particular through higher costs of energy imports invoiced in US dollars. The point was made that the improvements in competitiveness and support for growth that would normally be associated with a depreciation were being impeded by the prevailing global supply constraints and logistics restrictions. At the same time, it was suggested that most of the depreciation against the US dollar was due to divergent monetary policies, which partly reflected the differences in the outlook for the two economies. It was argued that, if the present risks of recession in the US economy were to materialise, the euro would be expected to appreciate. However, a countervailing – and probably dominant – effect could result from worsening global risk sentiment, which typically implied a strengthening of the US dollar.
Turning to euro area developments, economic activity was slowing and Russia’s war in Ukraine was an ongoing drag on growth. The adverse impact of high inflation on purchasing power and demand, continuous supply constraints and higher uncertainty were having a dampening effect on the economy. Firms continued to face higher costs and disruptions in their supply chains, although there were tentative signs that some of the supply bottlenecks were easing. Taken together, these factors were significantly clouding the outlook for the second half of 2022 and beyond. At the same time, economic activity continued to benefit from the reopening of the economy, a strong labour market and fiscal policy support. For instance, as people started to travel again, tourism was expected to help the economy in the coming months. Consumption was being supported by the savings that households had built up during the pandemic and by a strong labour market, where unemployment had fallen to a historical low of 6.6% in May and job vacancies across many sectors showed that there was robust demand for labour.
In their discussion, members noted that there were increasing signs of a downturn in euro area economic activity that could extend into 2023. PMI survey data for output in manufacturing and services pointed to a loss of momentum. In the case of manufacturing, the indicator had dropped to contractionary territory for the first time since mid-2020. Survey data on new orders and business expectations suggested that this weakening would continue in the coming months. Moreover, consumer confidence had declined to an all-time low. Inflation was eroding real wealth and savings, as well as real incomes, and the decline in equity prices pointed to negative effects on capital expenditure. Against this background, caution was warranted regarding the prospects for consumption and investment demand. At the same time, it was reiterated that the euro area economy had demonstrated considerable strength and resilience in the face of multiple crises, notably with regard to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Additionally, there were no indications of a major recession in the euro area so far. In this context, a good understanding of the current resilience of labour market dynamics was needed.
Members broadly agreed that the risks to economic activity were on the downside. A prolongation of the war in Ukraine remained a source of significant downside risk to growth, especially if energy supplies from Russia were disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing for firms and households. Indeed, the possibility of Russian gas supply shortages increased the probability of a recession. More generally, the war might further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side constraints, while a faster deceleration in global growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook. The risk of a renewed pandemic wave was seen as still looming, with infection rates remaining high despite favourable weather conditions. Overall, it was acknowledged that developments in energy markets warranted close attention, but it was also stressed that the baseline scenarios of the June staff projections and the European Commission forecasts just published did not foresee a recession.
Members agreed that fiscal policy was helping to cushion the impact of the war in Ukraine for those bearing the brunt of higher energy prices. Temporary and targeted measures should be tailored so as to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures. Fiscal policies in all countries should aim at preserving debt sustainability, as well as raising the growth potential in a sustainable manner to enhance the recovery. It was noted that the dispersion of inflation rates across euro area countries and the role played in this by energy and gas prices required a response that could not be provided by monetary policy alone but needed to be addressed by other policy areas. However, a warning was given that such calls should not be interpreted as recommending continued and untargeted fiscal stimulus.
On price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation had increased further to 8.6% in June, and surging energy prices had again been the most important component of overall inflation. Price pressures were spreading across more and more sectors, in part owing to the indirect impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation had risen further. Inflation was expected to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures from energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain. Higher inflationary pressures also stemmed from the depreciation of the euro exchange rate. Looking further ahead, in the absence of new disruptions, energy costs should stabilise and supply bottlenecks should ease, which, together with the ongoing policy normalisation, should support the return of inflation to the Governing Council’s target.
It was underlined that the latest inflation developments implied a clear materialisation of upside risks since the previous meeting of the Governing Council. Once more, June had seen an inflation surprise, confirming the underestimation bias observed in the recent past when outturns were compared with earlier projections. Not only had the inflation rate recorded in June increased to well above the projections, but also seasonally adjusted month-on-month rates pointed to continued strong momentum in almost all inflation components. It was also observed that the upward movement of inflation had taken place despite the dampening effect of temporary measures introduced to cope with high energy prices. Actual inflationary pressures were thus even greater than suggested by official readings and, to some extent, reflected government measures.
Against this background, it was argued that upside risks were clearly dominant in the short term. These upside risks were evident when updating the short-term projections by taking explicit account of the recent stronger month-on-month dynamics, the elevated level of oil refining margins, the stronger link between electricity prices and oil and gas futures, and the apparent faster pass-through of energy and producer prices to consumer prices. However, it was noted that such an updated short-term outlook could not easily be converted into an updated medium-term outlook. A key issue in the outlook for 2023 was the extent to which further inflation pressures were still to be observed, as, in the absence of further shocks, the large contribution of energy and food to the rise in inflation should otherwise diminish mechanically. Moreover, it remained to be seen by how much indirect effects would contribute to a further rise in core inflation over time.
In considering the possible persistence of inflationary pressures in the medium term, it was recalled that HICP projections did not as yet fully include costs for owner-occupied housing, while the latest data pointed to quite persistent upward pressures on housing costs despite recent increases in mortgage interest rates. It was also argued that upward shifts in medium-term inflation could emerge from structural changes to the economy. Examples were a possible partial reversal of globalisation and the green transition.
Over the usual projection horizon, it was seen as important to assess whether potential second-round effects or a weak anchoring of expectations would imply higher inflation over the medium term or whether current price pressures were simply one-off inflation bursts owing to the war and would stop once the adjustment was complete. The expected retreat of inflation from its anticipated peak later this year was seen to be predicated on two main factors: first, base effects, and second, a process of convergence with the target in line with Phillips curve predictions. However, it was cautioned that this type of prediction had disappointed more than once in the past. It was thus seen as questionable to keep shifting the short-term outlook upwards while keeping the end point unchanged, as the short-run situation would have an impact on persistence and thus propagate inflation tendencies into the medium term. In this respect, there might be more persistence in the inflation process than embedded in models where parameters were maintained at the values that had been estimated in a low-inflation environment, even though such values were likely to be changing as inflation moved higher. In addition, more persistent price pressures could emerge if the strong supply constraints implied that potential output was lower than initially thought. Such negative effects were all the more likely if there should be a failure to bring more people into the labour market.
Members agreed that the persistence of inflation depended, to a large extent, on the behaviour of wages. Wage growth, also according to forward-looking indicators, had continued to increase gradually over the last few months but still remained contained overall. Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-up effects were likely to support faster growth in wages. It was recalled that steady-state inflation of 2% was consistent with wages growing at 3% per year given typical productivity growth. Reference was made to indications from the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey, in which three-quarters of the respondents expected higher wage growth in 2023 than in 2022, pointing to an elevated risk of second-round effects. Reference was also made to the forward-looking wage tracker, which suggested a pick-up in wage growth and thus pointed to possible greater persistence of inflation.
Overall, it was maintained that there was no evidence of significant second-round effects as yet, but the repeated upward surprises as regards inflation and indications that inflation had become more persistent had increased the probability of such effects. In this context, reference was made to the Annual Economic Report 2022 from the Bank for International Settlements, which had concluded that transitions from low to high inflation regimes tended to be self-reinforcing, mainly owing to the occurrence of wage-price spirals. While members pointed out that wage formation in the euro area was built on overlapping multi-year wage agreements, this was also seen as implying that there could be long delays in higher inflation being reflected in the negotiation process. The catch-up of nominal wages in response to the current erosion of real wages might thus still take place. The risk was that, once wages started moving, they would keep increasing over the medium term, particularly in view of the higher persistence of inflation than observed in other major currency areas. It was argued that, thus far, the costs of the terms of trade shock had been borne essentially by workers. A rebalancing of the distribution of the implied “tax” between workers and employers would take some time, in part depending on productivity developments, bargaining power and the ability of firms to maintain profit margins. It was argued that there was a need to closely monitor wage developments, as these could transform price-level effects into presistent inflation. However, it was also remarked that a rebalancing between profits and wages would not necessarily represent the start of a wage-price spiral.
At the same time, the point was made that the current high rates of inflation could trigger increased wage indexation and then change the structural features of wage formation. This could reverse the earlier wage growth trend that had taken hold in a low-inflation environment. The current situation raised the question of why the apparent tightness of the labour market had not led to higher wage growth thus far. One explanation put forward was that workers were still hesitant to ask for higher wages, even though stronger pricing power for firms should have increased the scope for granting higher wages. This was corroborated by evidence from the Corporate Telephone Survey, with firms reporting both labour shortages and an easier pass-through of costs into higher selling prices. In this context, it was also pointed out that there was evidence of a higher frequency of repricing in the face of the current significant cost-push shocks.
With regard to longer-term inflation expectations, most measures were currently standing at around 2% and were thus still in line with the medium-term target. However, recent above-target revisions to some indicators warranted continued monitoring. Survey-based measures had edged up. In the case of the Survey of Professional Forecasters, longer-term expectations had risen to a new historical high of 2.2%. The median stood at 2%, but the increasing number of survey respondents at the upper end of the distribution of expectations was seen as an early warning sign of further shifts in the mean. The point was made that expectations had proven relatively slow to adjust upwards after many years of below-target inflation. If the same was now true in the opposite direction, it would be very difficult to re-anchor expectations once these had moved away from the target. Reference was also made to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey and the renewed upshift in inflation expectations three years ahead, after a temporary drop following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Such upward shifts might reflect “experience effects”, which could be very long-lived and hard to reverse.
The view was expressed that the latest survey data suggested a greater threat to anchoring than was apparent from financial market-based measures of inflation expectations. It was remarked that market-based measures of inflation compensation mattered for monetary policy because financial markets transmitted interest rate changes. So far no extreme movements had been observed in these measures, despite heightened volatility. The measures had actually declined since mid-June, with market participants expecting higher interest rates and lower economic growth. On the one hand, it was argued that their return to just above 2% – a level last seen in January – suggested that expectations were well anchored. This was seen to corroborate the notion that the current high inflation was being driven mainly by supply factors and not by expectations. On the other hand, the question was raised as to whether this could be seen as a stable anchoring when these expectations had first risen substantially to almost 2.5% and then fallen again by the same amount. This cautioned against drawing too much comfort from market-based measures and models that used them as inputs.
Against this background, members assessed that the risks to the inflation outlook continued to be on the upside and had intensified, particularly in the short term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above the Governing Council’s target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term in the wake of an economic slowdown, it would lower pressures on prices.
Risks to the medium-term inflation outlook were seen to be clearly tilted to the upside. It was argued that even a recession would not necessarily diminish upside risks, especially if it was related to a gas cut-off or another supply shock implying a further increase in inflation. At the same time, the point was made that this scenario of low growth but high and persistent inflation owing to supply shocks could be contrasted with a scenario where low growth would itself take care of high inflation. This appeared to be the current view of the markets, which were reflecting a combination of lower growth expectations and lower inflation expectations. In this respect the behaviour of the unions in response to a recession was seen as crucial.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessment provided by Mr Lane in his introduction. Bank funding costs had risen in recent months, which had increasingly fed into higher bank lending rates, in particular for households. It was remarked, however, that the increase in bank funding costs had remained contained – probably owing to the fact that banks were generally not yet paying interest on customer deposits and continued to have access to favourable Eurosystem funding, including from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). Moreover, the transmission of higher funding costs to lending rates was incomplete in some countries – perhaps owing to strong competition among banks or typical lags in the transmission. However, bank lending rates might start to increase more strongly in the coming quarters. While the volume of bank lending to households remained strong, it could be expected to decline in view of lower demand for loans.
Lending to firms had been robust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding had created a continued need for credit from banks. At the same time, demand for loans to finance investment had declined. Money growth had continued to moderate owing to lower liquid savings and lower Eurosystem asset purchases. The most recent bank lending survey had reported that credit standards had tightened for all loan categories in the second quarter of the year, as banks were becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers in the current uncertain environment.
Overall, despite the increase in the cost of borrowing and a decline in equity prices, monetary and financial conditions were assessed as having remained favourable, also taking into account the contribution from the exchange rate. Real interest rates for short maturities had declined since the June Governing Council meeting, as expected inflation had been revised upwards, while for longer maturities real rates had increased somewhat. Market interest rates had been volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopolitical uncertainty. It was remarked that market expectations for the terminal rate in the interest rate hiking cycle had also displayed significant volatility, increasing until mid-June on the back of higher interest rate expectations and decreasing thereafter when perceived recession risks rose.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members agreed that it was appropriate to take further steps on the path of monetary policy normalisation. In recent months inflation had repeatedly been higher than expected, and some of the upside risks that the Governing Council had anticipated in June had materialised, while further increases in energy prices were dampening the economic growth outlook. Medium-term risks had also increased. It was recalled that monetary policy was not able to provide effective support when the economy was hit by a series of supply shocks. As witnessed during the pandemic, governments were better able to provide support to households and firms, leaving monetary policy to focus on inflation developments and take the necessary action in line with the ECB’s mandate.
Inflationary pressures were judged to have intensified since the Governing Council’s June meeting, especially in the short term. It was highlighted that persistently high inflation posed an increasing risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored, even though both market-based measures of inflation compensation and survey-based longer-term inflation expectations were still broadly in line with the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation target. It was cautioned that a continued anchoring of inflation expectations was dependent on the Governing Council acting decisively on the worsening inflation outlook.
Against this background it was seen as appropriate to reaffirm the Governing Council’s determination to bring inflation back to its 2% target over the medium term, particularly in view of the fact that an instrument was being established to prevent unwarranted, disorderly reactions in financial markets to the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy and to safeguard a smooth monetary policy transmission throughout the euro area.
Members first discussed Mr Lane’s proposal to approve the TPI, as put forward by the Executive Board. Members highlighted the importance of the measure, which was seen as a decisive step to ensure the smooth transmission of the monetary policy stance and enable the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. The TPI would strengthen the Governing Council’s toolkit when fragmentation threatened the transmission of monetary policy, and would complement reinvestment flexibility under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme. Confidence was expressed that the TPI, with clear eligibility criteria, a well-structured process for its activation and conditions for an exit from its use, would support the stabilising potential of the toolkit and allow an effective response in the event of unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics. In this vein, the TPI would complement the other instruments available to address fragmentation by helping to support a smooth transmission of monetary policy across all the euro area countries while the stance was being normalised. It was argued that a detailed monetary policy case for the TPI and a clear framework for its activation were essential.
The TPI was deemed an important way to increase the resilience of Economic and Monetary Union, which – due to decentralised fiscal policy and the lack of a fully-fledged capital markets and banking union – was still incomplete and exposed to asymmetric shocks. This incompleteness would only disappear with fundamental changes to the euro area’s architecture. In this context, monetary policy had to play its role, within the ECB’s mandate, in addressing fragmentation to the extent that it impeded a smooth transmission of the monetary policy stance, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. Fragmentation risks were considered to be more likely in the current environment, in which monetary policy was being normalised at a time of large supply-side shocks and increasing risks to economic growth. While the ECB was taking action to preserve the efficiency of monetary policy, it was suggested that European governments should, within their own domain of responsibility, advance institutional reforms in order to better address the underlying sources of fragmentation in the euro area.
The design of the TPI was considered to be proportionate and to contain sufficient safeguards and conditions to ensure that the Governing Council acted within its mandate. It was recalled that the European Court of Justice had confirmed in its case law that, in exercising its competence in monetary policy in the pursuit of price stability, the Governing Council had broad discretion but had to carry out a thorough proportionality assessment of any new initiative. The comprehensive work on the TPI carried out over the past three months by the Eurosystem committees and ECB staff clearly documented the fact that the Governing Council was basing its decisions on a thorough analysis along the three dimensions of the proportionality assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and limited side effects. That analysis led to the conclusion that the instrument incorporated sufficient eligibility criteria and activation conditions, and a number of additional safeguards. This made the new instrument a proportionate response to the challenge posed by fragmentation to an effective and efficient conduct of monetary policy. It was also highlighted that the TPI was designed in such a way as to avoid weakening incentives for governments to pursue sound economic policies, particularly in the fiscal domain.
While it was remarked that the success of the TPI ultimately required sufficient commitment by governments to maintain the impetus for sound fiscal and economic policies, it was viewed as essential that the Governing Council underlined its readiness to use the TPI to the extent necessary to address risks to transmission and as appropriate under the stated conditions. Moreover, it was recalled that more persistent and fundamental problems were to be addressed by the OMT programme and that, while monetary policy was able to react to self-fulfilling liquidity crises, solvency problems had to be tackled by other actors. In this respect it was pointed out that, when assessing the sustainability of public debt, the Governing Council would take into account, where available, the debt sustainability analyses by the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism, the IMF and other institutions, together with the ECB’s internal analysis, without establishing a hierarchy between the analyses of the different institutions. Importantly, however, it was stressed that the Governing Council would undertake this assessment with full discretion.
In the light of the foregoing discussion, members unanimously supported the TPI as proposed by Mr Lane in his introduction. The unity and the team spirit in the discussion among the members of the Governing Council were widely praised, and the Eurosystem committees and staff at the ECB and national central banks were thanked for their efficient collaboration during the preparatory phase. A unanimous decision by the Governing Council with forceful and convincing communication was seen to lend strong credibility to the TPI.
Turning to the consideration of the current monetary policy stance, a very large number of members agreed that it was appropriate to raise the ECB’s key interest rates by 50 basis points as proposed by Mr Lane. A 50 basis point hike was seen as warranted in view of the worsening of the inflation outlook since the Governing Council’s June meeting. The Governing Council thereby took a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting, applying the stated principles of data-dependence and optionality. This was seen as providing a clear signal of its determination to act and to fulfil its mandate.
Some members argued in favour of raising the ECB key interest rates by 25 basis points as this was the intended move communicated at the Governing Council’s June meeting and would preserve consistency with the Governing Council’s earlier communication. With recession risks looming, an increase of 25 basis points was seen as more in line with a gradual monetary policy normalisation. It was also perceived as compatible with inflation returning to the Governing Council’s 2% target over the medium term once transitory shocks had faded. Moreover, the concern was raised that, if the Governing Council deviated from its earlier guidance and surprised markets with a larger than expected increase, this would add to the prevailing market uncertainties.
These considerations notwithstanding, it was maintained that the Governing Council had to demonstrate that it was willing and able to respond if the outlook changed. It was also argued that, despite constituting a larger than expected increase, a 50 basis point interest rate hike provided more clarity for market participants in a highly uncertain environment. Moreover, it was judged that the monetary policy stance remained accommodative even after a 50 basis point rise.
Members widely held the view that the TPI provided reinforced support for the effective transmission of monetary policy, thereby helping the Governing Council to proceed more decisively with the normalisation of monetary policy than envisaged at the June meeting. While the TPI was judged as allowing the Governing Council to address unwarranted, disorderly financial market developments more effectively, it was also perceived as necessary to enable the Governing Council to act more decisively to maintain price stability.
It was underlined that a decision to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at the present meeting should be regarded as frontloading the exit from negative rates and as part of the interest rate adjustment necessary to normalise monetary policy, rather than indicating a change in the rate to be expected as the end-point of the normalisation cycle. Indeed, the Governing Council was not changing its assessment regarding the terminal rate in the hiking cycle, which could only be determined more precisely when interest rates were approaching it more closely. A 50 basis point hike would take the deposit facility rate to zero, ending the period of negative interest rates, which were clearly no longer warranted in view of longer-term inflation expectations standing at or above 2% and the current high inflation numbers. Furthermore, it was argued that frontloading a 50 basis point increase in July would allow the Governing Council more flexibility in reacting to incoming data and proceeding with monetary policy normalisation at its future meetings.
Looking at the September meeting and further ahead, broad support was expressed for Mr Lane’s proposal to transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions. While providing forward guidance on interest rates was a powerful instrument in times when interest rates were close to the effective lower bound, its usefulness was judged as being significantly diminished in the normalisation phase. In the current circumstances with exceptionally high uncertainty, specific forward guidance on the future interest rate path was seen as excessively constraining the Governing Council’s optionality, flexibility and data-dependence, with the risk that the Governing Council would tie itself to decisions that it needed to reverse later when circumstances changed. In this context, attention was drawn to the continued forward guidance on the evolution of the Eurosystem balance sheet.
Different views were expressed as to the need for and the interpretation of the notion of gradualism and how to reconcile it with the need for data-dependence and optionality. On the one hand, it was stressed that in an uncertain environment in which incoming data pointed to increasing risks to price stability, optionality should take precedence over gradualism. On the other hand, it was maintained that gradualism should be interpreted as proceeding step by step with the policy normalisation and not jumping immediately to an end-point rate that was highly uncertain under current conditions. In that sense, a 50 basis point increase was regarded as gradual and compatible with the principles of flexibility, optionality and data-dependence, which would continue to govern the normalisation path.
Members agreed that flexibility in reinvestments of redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio remained the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. In the discussion it was questioned whether the narrowing of spreads observed since mid-June could be attributed to the activation of flexible PEPP reinvestments or whether it was linked to other factors, such as the expectation that the Governing Council would create a new tool to fight fragmentation and whether the activation of PEPP flexibility in June had been necessary.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Against this background, members expressed readiness to join a consensus on raising the ECB’s three key interest rates by 50 basis points. Communication had to acknowledge that upside risks to the inflation outlook had intensified, especially in the short term. It was also emphasised that the Governing Council’s decision was based on an updated assessment of the risks to the medium-term inflation outlook. The decision had to be seen as a further step in an ongoing normalisation process that had started in December last year with the phasing-out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. It was seen as important to stress that the 50 basis point hike did not consitute an upward shift in the interest rate path but rather a frontloading of the policy normalisation.
Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, and after having ascertained that there were no further comments, on a proposal by the President, the Governing Council approved the TPI with the broad conditions and safeguards set out in the dedicated press release.
The Governing Council also decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would be increased to 0.50%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively, with effect from 27 July 2022.
At the Governing Council’s upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates would be appropriate. The frontloading of the exit from negative interest rates allowed the Governing Council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions. The Governing Council’s future policy rate path would continue to be data-dependent and would help to deliver on its 2% inflation target over the medium term.
The Governing Council intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme (APP) for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio would be managed to avoid interference wit"

Credit standards tightened for firms and households, with uncertainty remaining high and monetary policy becoming less accommodative
Firms’ demand for loans continued to increase, driven by working capital needs
Banks report deterioration in access to wholesale funding
According to the July 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened considerably further (net percentage of banks standing at 16%, see Chart 1) in the second quarter of 2022. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 24%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened moderately (net percentage of 9%). In the context of high uncertainty, continuing supply chain disruptions and high energy and input prices, banks cite perceptions of increased risk and lower risk tolerance as factors behind the net tightening of credit standards for firms. As monetary policy is becoming less accommodative, euro area banks also reported that their cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had contributed to the tightening of credit standards for loans to firms and households. For the third quarter of 2022, they expect a net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms of a similar magnitude to that in the second quarter (18%). In addition, euro area banks expect credit standards to continue to tighten for both housing loans (24%) and consumer credit (13%).
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened for loans to firms and loans to households in the second quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, this was due mainly to a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans, while margins on average loans widened more moderately. Despite the net tightening of terms and conditions, margins on both loans for house purchase and consumer credit narrowed, partly reflecting the fact that market reference rates relevant for banks’ funding costs increased more than the interest rates on loans to households.
Banks reported, on balance, an increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the second quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital, which is likely related to the higher prices for energy and raw materials in the context of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, indicating that they may be postponing investment in the current uncertain environment. In addition, the positive contribution of the general level of interest rates to loan demand was more moderate compared with the previous quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, net demand for housing loans fell after increasing in the first quarter, while demand for consumer credit and other lending to households continued to rise in net terms. The net decrease in demand for housing loans was due mainly to lower consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates, while the increase in demand for consumer credit was driven predominantly by spending on durables. For the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a net decrease in firms’ demand for loans, a strong net decrease in demand for housing loans and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to money markets, securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions for banks. By contrast, access to retail funding improved slightly over the same period. In the first half of 2022, euro area banks’ non-performing loan ratios had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises, but there was no reported impact on loans for house purchase and consumer credit or other lending. Across most of the main economic sectors, euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises. They also reported a net increase in demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, in line with the reported overall increase in firms’ demand for loans in the first and second quarters of 2022.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the July 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the second quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the third quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The July 2022 survey round was conducted between 10 and 28 June 2022. A total of 153 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

,"Introduction
The results reported in the July 2022 bank lending survey (BLS) relate to changes observed during the second quarter of 2022 and expectations for the third quarter of 2022. The survey was conducted between 10 and 28 June 2022. A total of 153 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%. In addition to results for the euro area as a whole, this report also contains results for the four largest euro area countries.

A number of ad hoc questions were included in the July 2022 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios on their lending policies, and the change in bank lending conditions and loan demand across the main economic sectors.
1 Overview of results
In the July 2022 BLS, euro area banks indicated a considerable further tightening of their credit standards for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2022, i.e. the percentage share of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was considerably larger than the share of banks reporting an easing. Banks reported that risk perceptions related to the economic outlook, industry or firm-specific situation and banks’ decreased risk tolerance had a strong tightening impact on credit standards. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms, as monetary policy is becoming less accommodative. In the third quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms of a similar magnitude to the second quarter.
Firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the second quarter of 2022, in line with expectations in the previous quarter. Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital, likely related to increased production input prices in the context of continuing supply chain disruptions and high energy prices. At the same time, fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, suggesting that they are postponing their investment in the current uncertain environment. In addition, the positive contribution of the general level of interest rates to loan demand was more moderate than in the previous quarter. In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a moderate net decline in demand for loans to firms.
Banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and a moderate net tightening for consumer credit in the second quarter of 2022. The net tightening of credit standards for housing loans was considerably stronger than in the previous quarter and above the historical average. For housing loans, higher risk perceptions, lower risk tolerance and a moderate tightening impact from banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed to the net tightening. Higher risk perceptions also primarily contributed to the net tightening of credit standards on loans for consumer credit. Loan demand from households decreased in net terms for loans for house purchase and continued to increase in net terms for consumer credit in the second quarter of 2022. Lower consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates contributed negatively to demand for both categories, while durable goods consumption contributed to the net increase in consumer credit demand. In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a net tightening of credit standards for all lending to households. In addition, banks expect a strong net decrease in housing loan demand and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit.
In more detail, euro area banks tightened their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) considerably further for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the second quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 16%, after 6% in the first quarter of 2022; see Section 2.1). Risks related to the economic outlook and the industry or firm-specific situation had a considerable further tightening impact on credit standards in the second quarter of 2022. In the current environment of high uncertainty, banks’ risk tolerance declined, contributing to a tightening impact on credit standards. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a small tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms, as monetary policy is becoming less accommodative. In the third quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms of a similar magnitude to that in the second quarter (18%).
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of banks of 24%, after 2% in the first quarter of 2022; see Section 2.2), and a moderate net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (9%, after -5%; see Section 2.3), both stronger than anticipated in the previous quarter. The net tightening for housing loans was driven mainly by higher risk perceptions, lower risk tolerance and some country-specific factors. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a moderate tightening impact, while competition was the only factor that had a slight easing impact. For consumer credit, increased risk perceptions mainly contributed to the net tightening. Banks expect credit standards to continue tightening for both housing loans (24%) and for consumer credit (13%) in the third quarter of 2022.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened in the second quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 12%, after 3%). This tightening of terms and conditions, in the context of monetary policy normalisation, was mainly on account of a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans (net percentage of 16%; margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates), while the widening of margins on average loans (net percentage of 6%) and collateral requirements (net percentage of 5%) had a more moderate contribution. Banks also reported a net tightening of overall terms and conditions for both housing loans (net percentage of 22%, after 6%) and consumer credit and other lending to households (11%, after -2%). Despite the net tightening of terms and conditions, loan margins narrowed for both loans for house purchase and for consumer credit, partly reflecting the fact that market reference rates relevant for banks’ funding costs increased more than interest rates for loans to households.
In the second quarter of 2022, banks reported broadly no change in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 1%, after 4%). For housing loans, euro area banks reported a significant net increase in the share of rejected applications (28%, after 1%). This is the largest net increase in the share of rejected applications since the series began in the first quarter of 2015. The share of rejected applications increased moderately in net terms for consumer credit (5%, after -2%).
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened across all four largest euro area countries in the second quarter of 2022 (see Overview table). Credit standards for housing loans also tightened in all four countries, while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in Germany, France and Italy, and remained unchanged in France.
Firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the second quarter of 2022, in line with expectations in the previous quarter (net percentage of 12%, after 17% in the first quarter of 2022; see Section 2). Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital, which is likely related to increased energy and raw material prices in the context of continuing supply chain disruptions. The contribution of fixed investment to firms’ net demand for loans turned negative for the first time since the first quarter of 2021, indicating that firms may be postponing investment in the current uncertain environment. In line with subdued growth, sentiment indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) already signalled a contraction in manufacturing activity for the end of the second quarter. In addition, the positive contribution of the general level of interest rates to loan demand was more moderate compared with the previous quarter. Loan demand increased strongly in net terms for short-term maturities, which reflects firms’ increased need for working capital financing. At the same time, net demand for long-term loans was broadly unchanged in the second quarter of 2022. While the available monetary data show an increase in long-term loan flows for April and May, the leading indicator properties of BLS loan demand for net loan growth to firms would suggest a potential weakening in long-term loan growth in the coming months. In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a moderate net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -5%), due to a considerable decrease in long-term loans, while the demand for short-term loans is expected to be less strong than in the second quarter.
In the second quarter of 2022, net demand from households for housing loans fell after increasing in the first quarter (net percentage of -10%, after 10% in the first quarter of 2022; see Chart 4), while demand for consumer credit continued to increase in net terms (net percentage of 11%, after 11%, see Overview table). The net decrease in housing loan demand was mainly driven by lower consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates, possibly reflecting the significant increases recently observed in interest rates on housing loans. The increase in demand for consumer credit was mainly driven by demand for durables, likely reflecting recent price increases and the reopening of the economy. On the other hand, lower consumer confidence had a dampening effect on demand for consumer credit, in line with recent declines in the European Commission’s consumer sentiment indicator, while the general level of interest rates also had a slight negative contribution to demand. For the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a strong net decrease in the demand for housing loans (-47%) and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit (1%).
Banks reported, on balance, a net increase in demand for loans to enterprises in Germany and France, while loan demand remained unchanged according to banks in Italy, and decreased in Spain in the second quarter of 2022. Net demand for housing loans increased in Spain and fell in France, Germany and Italy. Net demand for consumer credit increased in France, Germany and Italy, and fell in Spain.
Overview table
Latest BLS results for the largest euro area countries
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards or an increase in loan demand)
Notes: The “Avg.” columns contain historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.
The July 2022 BLS also included a number of ad hoc questions. Euro area banks reported that their access to money markets, securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions for banks in the context of the ongoing monetary policy normalisation. By contrast, access to retail funding improved slightly in the second quarter of 2022. In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a slight deterioration in access to retail funding, and a continued deterioration in access to market-based funding, in particular debt securities funding.
In the first half of 2022, euro area banks’ NPL ratios had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises, and a neutral impact on credit standards for loans for house purchase and consumer credit and other lending. Over the next six months, euro area banks expect NPL ratios to have a continued tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises, a slight tightening impact on credit standards for consumer credit and other lending, and a broadly neutral impact on credit standards for loans for house purchase. Increased perceptions of risk, costs related to banks’ capital position, access to market financing and pressure related to supervisory or regulatory requirements contributed to a small net tightening impact of NPL ratios on lending conditions in the first half of 2022. At the same time, banks’ risk tolerance and liquidity positions had a neutral impact on lending conditions through banks’ NPLs, while costs related to balance sheet clean-up operations had a slight easing impact.
In the first half of 2022, euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises across most of the main economic sectors. These developments are broadly in line with the moderate net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms in the first quarter of 2022 and the more pronounced net tightening in the second quarter of 2022. Over the next six months, euro area banks expect a continued net tightening across all main economic sectors. Banks reported a net increase in demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, in line with the reported overall increase in demand for loans to firms in the first and second quarters of 2022. Over the next six months, euro area banks expect a strong decline in net demand in the real estate sector, and a small to moderate increase in services, wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing sectors.

General notes
The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 153 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.

BLS questionnaire
The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e. domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat or (5) eased/increased considerably.
In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).
Aggregation of banks’ replies to national and euro area BLS results
The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.
In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.
[

]
For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.
In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares of lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.
BLS indicators
Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e. they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.
[

]
The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.
A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).
Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e. an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.
In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.
In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.
Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via the Statistical Data Warehouse.
A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on the ECB's website.

Euro area banks tightened their credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) considerably further for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the second quarter of 2022, i.e. the percentage share of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was considerably larger than the share of banks reporting an easing (net percentage of banks of 16%, after 6% in the first quarter of 2022; see Chart 1 and Overview table). Credit standards remained somewhat below banks’ expectations in the previous quarter; nevertheless, the extent of net tightening was similar to levels recorded during the early stages of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and was above historical averages. In the second quarter of 2022, credit standards tightened more strongly for loans to large firms (16%, after 7%), compared with loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs; 10%, after 7%; see Chart 2) and more strongly for long-term loans (16%, after 6%) than for short-term loans (9%, after 5%).
Banks indicated a considerable further net tightening impact related to the economic outlook and industry or firm-specific situation in the second quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1 and Table 1). In addition to risk perceptions, banks’ risk tolerance declined strongly, contributing to a tightening impact on credit standards in the current environment of high uncertainty. As monetary policy is becoming less accommodative, banks reported that their cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a small tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. This reflects a moderate tightening impact related to capital costs, a small tightening effect from market financing and a broadly neutral effect from banks’ liquidity situation. Competition had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms, mainly related to competition from market financing. Banks indicated higher risk perceptions related to the economic outlook as well as the creditworthiness of borrowers and decreased risk tolerance as the main factors explaining the development in credit standards across firm sizes (see Chart 2). While cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a rather small impact on credit standards for loans to SMEs, the tightening impact was moderate for large firms, related to a moderate tightening impact from capital costs.

Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “bank’s capital and the costs related to bank’s capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.

Note: See the notes on Chart 1.
Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened across all four largest euro area countries in the second quarter of 2022. Higher perceived risks and banks’ lower risk tolerance were the main driving factors in Spain, France and Italy. In addition, banks in Italy and France referred to an overall tightening impact from competition, which is related to lower competition from market financing, while French banks also referred to competition from non-banks as financial market conditions become less favourable. A tightening impact of cost of funds and balance sheet constraints was reported by banks in Italy, driven by higher capital costs, by banks’ ability to access market financing and, to a smaller extent, by their liquidity position.
In the third quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a net tightening of similar magnitudes to those in the second quarter for credit standards on loans to firms (net percentage of 18%), both for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 15%) and large enterprises (net percentage of 18%).

Note: See the notes on Chart 1.
2.1.2 Terms and conditions on loans to enterprises tightened
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened in the second quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 12%, after 3%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). This was mainly on account of a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans (net percentage of 16%; margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates), while the widening of margins on average loans (net percentage of 6%) and collateral requirements (net percentage of 5%) had a more moderate contribution. Tighter terms and conditions are confirmed by data on the actual aggregate cost of borrowing for firms, showing an increase in rates for May 2022, the latest available month. Banks also reported that changes in maturity, covenants and non-interest rate charges contributed to the net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to firms. Developments in overall terms and conditions were similar for loans to SMEs and large firms, with the widening of margins on riskier loans being considerable across both firm categories, whereas the widening of margins on average loans had broadly no impact for SMEs, and a moderate impact for large firms (see Chart 4). Other terms and conditions related to changes in collateral, covenants and maturity had a moderate impact on the terms and conditions for loans to large firms and SMEs.

Chart 4
Changes in terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Note: See the notes on Chart 3.
Banks’ higher risk perceptions, cost of funds and decreased risk tolerance were the main drivers of the net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2022 (see Table 3). In the current environment of high uncertainty, risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of firms had a large tightening impact on terms and conditions, whereas the impact of the collateral demanded was more moderate. As monetary policy is becoming less accommodative, banks indicated that costs related to both capital and market financing had a tightening impact on credit standards, while competition related to market financing also had a moderate tightening impact for overall terms and conditions.

(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. See the notes on Chart 1.
In the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened, on balance, in Germany, Spain and Italy, and remained unchanged in France in the second quarter of 2022. Across the four largest economies, banks mentioned higher risk perceptions as the main factor which contributed to tightening, while banks’ decreased risk tolerance had a tightening impact for overall terms and conditions in Germany, Spain and Italy. In addition, capital costs contributed to a tightening in Germany and Italy, while increased market financing costs contributed to a tightening of credit conditions across all four largest euro area countries. Banks in Germany and Italy also reported a tightening impact of their liquidity position on overall terms and conditions. Margins on both average and riskier loans to firms widened in Germany, Spain and Italy, while in France margins widened for riskier loans and narrowed for average loans.
2.1.3 Rejection rate for loans to enterprises was broadly unchanged
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported broadly no change in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 1%, after 4% in the previous quarter). This development may suggest that tightening credit standards have, on balance, not yet translated to more rejections for new loans to firms. The net increase in the share of rejected loan applications was similarly small for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 3%) and for loans to large firms (net percentage of 2%).
Across the largest euro area countries, banks reported that in net terms the share of rejected applications increased in Spain and Germany, was unchanged in France and decreased in Italy. Developments were similar across firm sizes for Spain and France, while the net increase in the share of rejected applications was higher for large firms in Germany, related to the more pronounced tightening of lending standards for large firms in comparison with SMEs. The net decrease in the rejection rate in Italy was entirely driven by the net decrease for loans to large firms.
2.1.4 Net demand for loans to enterprises continued to increase
According to euro area banks, firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the second quarter of 2022, in line with the expectations in the previous quarter (net percentage of 12%, after 17% in the first quarter of 2022; see Chart 5 and Overview table). Loan demand increased strongly in net terms for short-term maturities (net percentage of 23%), reflecting firms’ increased need to cover higher production costs and working capital. At the same time, net demand for long-term loans was broadly unchanged (net percentage of 1%) in the second quarter of 2022. While the available monetary data show an increase in long-term loan flows for April and May, leading indicator properties of BLS loan demand for net loan growth to firms would suggest a potential weakening in long-term loan growth in the coming months.

In addition, BLS banks indicated that loan demand increased in net terms for SMEs (net percentage of 9%, see Chart 6) and for large firms (net percentage of 14%).

(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.
Chart 6
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 5. Developments across firm sizes in the factors having an impact on loan demand were added in the April 2022 survey round.
Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital, which is likely related to increased energy and raw material prices and continuing supply chain disruptions (see Chart 5 and Table 4). For the first time since the first quarter of 2021, fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, as they may be postponing investment in the current uncertain environment. In line with subdued growth, sentiment indicators such as the PMI already signal a contraction in manufacturing activity for the end of the second quarter. In addition, the positive contribution of the general level of interest rates to loan demand was more moderate (net percentage of 3%) compared with the previous quarter. Loan demand was also supported, on balance, by other financing needs related to debt restructuring. While banks indicated tightening credit conditions for loans to corporates, firms might still have incentives to frontload their demand for loans or renegotiate loan amounts or maturities against the background of expected further monetary policy normalisation. Loan demand was also supported, on balance, by other financing needs related to debt securities issuance pointing to substitution effects away from market-based financing in the context of market rates increasing more strongly than lending rates. Across firm sizes, banks reported that the increase in loan demand for inventories and working capital was more pronounced for large firms than for SMEs in the second quarter of 2022, which is in line with larger firms being more exposed to international markets and therefore to the current supply chain disruptions (see Chart 6). The dampening impact of fixed investment on loan demand was similar across firm sizes. In addition, other financing needs related to debt restructuring had a moderate positive impact on loan demand for large firms, whereas mergers and acquisitions had a positive impact for SMEs. The general level of interest rates had a broadly neutral impact on loan demand across firm sizes.
Table 4
Factors contributing to changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 5.
In the largest euro area countries, banks reported a net increase in demand for loans to firms in Germany and France, while loan demand remained unchanged according to banks in Italy and decreased in Spain in the second quarter of 2022. Across all four largest euro area countries, financing needs for inventories and working capital had a strong positive impact on loan demand, while fixed investment had a moderate to strong negative impact. For firms in France and Italy, banks indicated a moderate positive impact from the general level of interest rates, possibly related to frontloading effects, whereas this factor had a negative impact for firms in Germany and Spain. In terms of other financing needs, debt restructuring had a positive impact on loan demand in all countries except Italy, while mergers and acquisitions had a negative impact in Germany and France. Debt securities issuance as a source of alternative finance had a positive impact on demand in Spain, France and Italy. However, the overall impact of alternative financing on loan demand was negative in Italy, due to the large negative impact of loans from other banks and non-banks.
In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a net decline in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of -5%), for both SMEs (net percentage of -8%) and large firms (net percentage of -3%). Demand for long-term loans is expected to decrease considerably (net percentage of -14%), while the demand for short-term loans is expected to remain positive (net percentage of 12%), albeit less strong than in the second quarter.
2.2 Loans to households for house purchase
2.2.1 Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened strongly
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of banks at 24%, after 2% in the first quarter of 2022; see Chart 7 and Overview table), above expectations reported in the previous survey round, and markedly above the historical average for credit standards (6%).
Chart 7
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “bank’s capital and the costs related to bank’s capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “housing market prospects, including expected house price developments” and “borrower’s creditworthiness”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards, currently mainly related to macroprudential policy recommendations.
Perceptions of increased risk and country-specific other factors contributed to the net tightening, alongside a moderate impact from banks’ lower risk tolerance, and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints (see Chart 7 and Table 5). Banks reported a more pronounced contribution from increased perceptions of risk than in the previous quarter, stemming from views on the general economic outlook, borrower creditworthiness and housing market prospects. This marks the second consecutive quarter of risk perceptions having a tightening impact, which excluding the pandemic period, had not been recorded since 2014. Coupled with a fall in demand (Section 2.2.4), this may indicate a possible turning point in housing market lending conditions. Country-specific other factors also contributed considerably to the net tightening, especially in France. In addition, there was a moderate positive impact from banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, particularly from costs related to banks’ capital positions. At the same time, pressure from competition from other banks was the only factor that had an easing impact.
Across all four largest euro area countries, credit standards tightened in net terms. Some banks in France noted that, while competition from banks and a higher risk tolerance had a net easing effect, regulations set by the French High Council for Financial Stability and the usury rate (a maximum interest rate on loans) contributed towards a tightening impact. In Germany, Italy and Spain, the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, a higher level of risk perceptions, and lower risk tolerance contributed towards a tightening, with a neutral impact from competition.
In the third quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a continued pronounced net tightening of credit standards on loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of banks of 24%).
Table 5

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 7.
2.2.2 Terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase tightened strongly
Banks reported a strong net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans in the second quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 22%, after 6% in the previous quarter; see Chart 8 and Table 6). This reflects increases in the level of interest rates (recorded under “other factors” in Chart 8), in line with increases in euro area mortgage interest rates observed since the beginning of 2022. At the same time, there was a net narrowing of banks’ margins on average loans and a slight net narrowing of margins on riskier loans. This was due to relevant market reference rates rising faster than interest rates charged on housing loans, leading to a contraction in loan margins. In addition, a slight net tightening of loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, other loan size limits (part of “other terms and conditions” in Chart 8) and collateral requirements was reported.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “loan-to-value ratio”, “other loan size limits”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Table 6
Changes in terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 8.
Perceived risks and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, in line with the reported impact of higher market interest rates in the context of monetary policy normalisation, contributed to a net tightening of overall terms and conditions (see Table 7). In addition, banks’ lower risk tolerance contributed towards a tightening of terms and conditions and had a widening impact on margins. On the other hand, pressure from competition had a broadly neutral impact on overall terms and conditions.
In all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for housing loans tightened in net terms. It should be noted, however, that loan margins narrowed markedly in France on both average and riskier loans, because the interest rate on loans had not risen as quickly as market reference rates. Margins widened for both riskier and average loans in Germany and Spain. Additionally, Italian and German banks noted a tightening of LTV ratios, while German banks also recorded a tightening of other loan size limits, and Italian banks reported tighter maturity limits. In all countries, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions contributed towards a tightening of terms and conditions. German, Spanish and Italian banks reported that increased perceptions of risk and lower risk tolerance contributed towards a tightening, but French banks noted a neutral impact from these factors. Competition had a tightening effect in Germany and Italy, an easing effect in Spain, and a neutral impact in France.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.2.3 Rejection rate for housing loans increased strongly
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported, on balance, a strong increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for housing loans (28%, after 1% in the previous quarter). This was the largest net increase since the series began in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the current environment of uncertainty surrounding lending, and the tightening of credit standards.
Across the four largest euro area countries, the share of loans that were rejected increased in Germany, Spain and France, while it was unchanged in Italy.
2.2.4 Net demand for housing loans decreased
Banks reported a decrease in net demand for housing loans in the second quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of -10%, after 10% in the first quarter of 2022; see Chart 9 and Overview table), in line with previous expectations.
Chart 9
Changes in demand for loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 5. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation” and “regulatory and fiscal regime of housing markets”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal finance of house purchase out of savings/down payment”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”.
Declining consumer confidence and the current interest rate environment both contributed negatively towards loan demand (see Chart 9 and Table 8). The negative contribution of consumer confidence reflects the latest figures from the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator, which in June 2022 fell to its lowest level since the early stages of the pandemic. The negative net impact of the level of interest rates on loan demand marks a reversal compared with previous quarters and indicates that the recent considerable increases in interest rates on loans for house purchase may be starting to have a downward impact on demand. While actual mortgage lending volumes remained strong in May, the reported decrease in demand alongside tightening terms and conditions and credit standards may be an early signal of a turning point in euro area lending for house purchase. Housing market prospects had a broadly neutral impact on overall demand, after a declining positive impact in the previous quarter. Excluding the early pandemic period, this was the first time since 2013 that housing market prospects had not contributed positively to housing loan demand. In addition, other financing needs and the use of alternative finance also had a broadly neutral impact.
Across the largest euro area countries, banks in Germany, France and Italy recorded a net decrease in demand for housing loans, while banks in Spain reported a net increase in the second quarter of 2022. In Germany, lower consumer confidence drove the net decline, while in France and Italy banks reported that both consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates had a negative impact. Spanish banks attributed the reported increase to housing market conditions and the current interest rate environment, possibly related to frontloading effects.
In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a strong net decline in the demand for housing loans (net percentage of banks of -47%). It would be the largest decline since the second quarter of 2020 and, if the pandemic period is excluded, the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008.

2.3 Consumer credit and other lending to households
2.3.1 Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened moderately
Banks reported a moderate net tightening of credit standards on consumer credit and other lending to households in the second quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 9%; see Chart 10 and Overview table). This was the first net tightening since the first quarter of 2021.
Banks’ increased risk perceptions mainly contributed to the net tightening of credit standards (see Chart 10 and Table 9). This was mostly related to perceptions regarding the economic outlook and the creditworthiness of consumers and to a small extent to the risks related to the collateral demanded. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a slight tightening effect.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms in Germany, Spain and Italy, and were unchanged on balance in France. Increased risk perceptions contributed towards the net tightening in Germany, Spain and Italy, while Spanish and Italian banks also reported that lower risk tolerance had a net tightening impact. In addition, banks in Italy noted that their cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed towards a tightening. While credit standards were unchanged on balance in France, banks reported an easing contribution from higher risk tolerance.
In the third quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a continued net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 13%).

The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.

2.3.2 Terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households tightened
In the second quarter of 2022, banks’ overall terms and conditions applied when granting consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms (net percentage of 11%, after -2% in the previous quarter; see Chart 11 and Table 10). While interest rates increased, (part of “other factors” in Chart 11), it should be noted that there was a considerable net narrowing of margins on average loans (net percentage of -17%) and a net narrowing of margins on riskier loans (-10%), as market reference rates increased faster than interest rates on consumer credit.
Chart 11
Changes in terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “size of the loan”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Reflecting this, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions contributed towards a net tightening of terms and conditions (net percentage of 10%; see Table 11), but also towards a narrowing of margins on average and riskier loans (-16% and -13% respectively). Increased perceptions of risk also had a moderate tightening impact on overall terms and conditions.
Across all four largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened in net terms. In Germany, this tightening was related to a widening of loan margins and restrictions on the size of loans. Spanish banks also noted a net widening of margins for riskier loans. Despite the headline tightening of terms and conditions, which was related to higher interest rates (part of “other factors”), banks in Spain, Italy and France reported a net narrowing of loan margins on average loans, while French and Italian banks also reported a net narrowing of margins on riskier loans. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions had a net tightening impact on overall terms and conditions in Germany, Spain and Italy, but a neutral impact in France. Competition had a tightening impact in France and Italy, a neutral impact in Germany and an easing impact in Spain. French banks reported that higher risk tolerance had an easing impact, while German banks also attributed the tightening of terms and conditions to increased perceptions of risk.

Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.3.3 Rejection rate for consumer credit and other lending to households increased moderately
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a moderate net increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for consumer credit and other lending to households (5%, after -2% in the previous survey round). This is consistent with the reported moderate net tightening in credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households in the second quarter of 2022.
Across the largest euro area countries, the rejection rate increased on balance in Germany and Spain, whereas it was unchanged in Italy and France.
2.3.4 Net demand for consumer credit and other lending to households increased
In the second quarter of 2022, banks reported a continued net increase in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of banks at 11%, after 11% in the previous quarter; see Chart 12 and Overview table). This is broadly in line with recently observed increases in the annual growth rate in loans for consumer credit.
Chart 12
Changes in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 5. “Use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing out of savings”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”. “Consumption exp. (real estate)” denotes “consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans”.
Spending on durable goods made a continued positive contribution to demand for consumer credit (see Chart 12 and Table 12), likely reflecting recent price increases and the reopening of the economy. Conversely, consumer confidence had a negative contribution to demand, after a positive contribution last quarter, reflecting the observed recent decline in the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator. The general level of interest rates had a dampening effect on demand, reflecting in part the pass-through of higher interest rates to consumers. Use of alternative finance had a broadly neutral impact on demand.
Across the four largest euro area countries, banks in Germany, Italy and France reported a net increase in demand for consumer credit, while banks in Spain reported a net decrease. In Germany, increased spending on durables was the primary driver of the increase in demand, while the general level of interest rates, consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans and a lower use of internal savings also had a slight positive impact. Italian banks reported spending on durables as being the key driver of increased demand, while lower consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates had a dampening effect. For French banks, the increase in demand was attributed to a more limited use of internal savings for financing, while lower consumer confidence and the interest rate environment had a net downward effect. The decline recorded in Spain was attributed to both the use of internal savings as a financing source and declining consumer confidence.
In the third quarter of 2022, banks expect demand for consumer credit and other lending to remain broadly unchanged (net percentage of 1%).

3 Ad hoc questions
3.1 Banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding
The July 2022 survey included a question on the extent to which the situation in financial markets had affected banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding.
In the second quarter of 2022, banks reported that their access to money markets, securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated in net terms, reflecting the tightening of market-based funding conditions for banks. By contrast, access to retail funding improved slightly (net percentage of -2% reported deteriorated access, after -1% in the first quarter of 2022; see Chart 13). Compared with monetary data, household deposit inflows remained robust in May 2022, whereas deposit flows of firms were close to zero in April and May. The impact of elevated inflation on deposits and recent corporate deposit developments may signal a deterioration in access to retail funds, which is partly expected by banks for the third quarter of 2022. Access to debt securities deteriorated markedly in the second quarter of 2022.

(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)
Note: See the notes on Chart 13.
In the third quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect, on balance, a continued pronounced deterioration in their access to market funding, reflecting further expectations of monetary policy normalisation. Access to debt securities (net percentage of 25%), securitisation (net percentage of 4%) and money markets (net percentage of 7%) is expected to deteriorate. In addition, banks expect their access to retail funds to deteriorate, driven by an expected deterioration for long-term deposits (net percentage of 5%), while access to short-term deposits is expected to remain unchanged (net percentage of 0%).
3.2 The impact of banks’ NPL ratios on their lending policies
The July 2022 survey questionnaire included a biannual ad hoc question about the impact that banks’ NPL ratios had on their lending policies and the factors through which NPL ratios contributed to changes in lending policies. Banks were asked about the impact on loans to enterprises, loans to households for house purchase, and consumer credit and other lending to households over the past six months and the next six months.
Euro area banks reported a small net tightening impact of their NPL ratios on credit standards for loans to enterprises in the first half of 2022 (net percentage of 2%, after 2% in the first half of 2021, see Chart 14) and a neutral impact for loans to households for house purchase (0% after 0%) and for consumer credit and other lending (0% after 2%). Banks reported that NPL ratios had a slight tightening effect on terms and conditions for loans to firms (2%, after -1%), a neutral impact for housing loans (0%, after -2%), and a small easing impact on conditions for consumer credit (-2%, after 0%) in the first half of 2022 (see Chart 14).
Banks cited increased perceptions of risk, costs related to their capital position, access to market financing, and pressure related to supervisory or regulatory requirements as contributing to a small net tightening impact of NPL ratios on lending conditions in the first half of 2022 (see Chart 15). At the same time, costs related to balance sheet clean-up had a slight easing impact while banks’ risk tolerance and liquidity positions had a neutral impact on lending conditions.
Chart 14
Impact of banks’ NPL ratios on credit standards and terms and conditions
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The NPL ratio is defined as the stock of gross NPLs on a bank’s balance sheet as a percentage of the gross carrying amount of loans. Changes in credit standards and/or terms and conditions can be caused by changes to the NPL ratio or by changes to regulations or the bank’s assessment of the level of the NPL ratio. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “contributed considerably to tightening” and “contributed somewhat to tightening” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “contributed somewhat to easing” and “contributed considerably to easing”. The diamonds denote expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Over the next six months, euro area banks expect NPL ratios to have a tightening impact on both credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to firms, a slight tightening impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for loans for consumer credit, and a broadly neutral impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for loans for house purchase. Pressures related to supervisory or regulatory requirements and costs related to capital positions of banks are expected to have a tightening impact on lending policies via NPL ratios. Access to market financing, increased perceived risks and lower risk tolerance are expected to slightly reinforce this tightening effect. At the same time, the impact of banks’ liquidity positions and costs related to balance sheet clean-up operations are expected to have a neutral impact.

3.3 Bank lending conditions and loan demand across main sectors of economic activity
The July 2022 survey questionnaire included a biannual ad hoc question to collect information on changes in banks’ credit standards, overall terms and conditions and loan demand across the main economic sectors over the past and next six months. Banks were asked to provide information covering five sectors: manufacturing, construction (excluding real estate), services (excluding financial services and real estate), wholesale and retail trade, and real estate (including both real estate construction and real estate services).
Euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening in credit standards for new loans to enterprises across most of the main economic sectors in the first half of 2022 (see Chart 16). These developments are broadly in line with the moderate net tightening in credit standards for loans to f"

Conversion rate of kuna fixed at 7.53450 = EUR 1
Croatian banks already supervised by ECB since 2020
Today the Council of the European Union formally approved the accession of Croatia to the euro area on 1 January 2023 and determined a Croatian kuna conversion rate of 7.53450 per euro – this coincides with the level of the current central rate of the kuna in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II). The European Central Bank (ECB) and Hrvatska narodna banka agreed to monitor developments in the Croatian kuna against the euro on the foreign exchange market until 1 January 2023.
With the entry into force of the close cooperation framework between the ECB and Hrvatska narodna banka on 1 October 2020, the ECB became responsible for directly supervising eight significant institutions and overseeing 15 less significant institutions in Croatia.

Notes
The agreement to monitor the kuna is in the context of ERM II. Participation in ERM II and observance of the normal fluctuation margins for at least the last two years is one of the convergence criteria to be fulfilled ahead of euro area accession.
The conversion rate of the kuna is set by way of an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 2866/98, which will become effective on 1 January 2023."

ECB to account for climate change in its corporate bond purchases, collateral framework, disclosure requirements and risk management, in line with its climate action plan
Measures aim to reduce financial risk related to climate change on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, encourage transparency, and support the green transition of the economy
Measures to be regularly reviewed to check that they are fit for purpose and aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to take further steps to include climate change considerations in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy framework. It decided to adjust corporate bond holdings in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy portfolios and its collateral framework, to introduce climate-related disclosure requirements and to enhance its risk management practices.
These measures are designed in full accordance with the Eurosystem’s primary objective of maintaining price stability. They aim to better take into account climate-related financial risk in the Eurosystem balance sheet and, with reference to our secondary objective, support the green transition of the economy in line with the EU’s climate neutrality objectives. Moreover, our measures provide incentives to companies and financial institutions to be more transparent about their carbon emissions and to reduce them.
“With these decisions we are turning our commitment to fighting climate change into real action”, says ECB President Christine Lagarde. “Within our mandate, we are taking further concrete steps to incorporate climate change into our monetary policy operations. And, as part of our evolving climate agenda, there will be more steps to align our activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement.”
The following concrete measures have been decided:
Corporate bond holdings: The Eurosystem aims to gradually decarbonise its corporate bond holdings, on a path aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. To that end, the Eurosystem will tilt these holdings towards issuers with better climate performance through the reinvestment of the sizeable redemptions expected over the coming years. Better climate performance will be measured with reference to lower greenhouse gas emissions, more ambitious carbon reduction targets and better climate-related disclosures.
Tilting means that the share of assets on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet issued by companies with a better climate performance will be increased compared to that by companies with a poorer climate performance. This aims to mitigate climate-related financial risks on the Eurosystem balance sheet. It also provides incentives to issuers to improve their disclosures and reduce their carbon emissions in the future.
The ECB expects the measures to apply from October 2022, and further details will follow shortly before then. The ECB will start publishing climate-related information on corporate bond holdings regularly as of the first quarter of 2023.
In any case, the volume of corporate bond purchases will continue to be determined solely by monetary policy considerations and their role in achieving the ECB’s inflation target.
Collateral framework: The Eurosystem will limit the share of assets issued by entities with a high carbon footprint that can be pledged as collateral by individual counterparties when borrowing from the Eurosystem. The new limits regime aims to reduce climate-related financial risks in Eurosystem credit operations. At first, the Eurosystem will apply such limits only to marketable debt instruments issued by companies outside the financial sector (non-financial corporations). Additional asset classes may also fall under the new limits regime as the quality of climate-related data improves. The measure is expected to apply before the end of 2024 provided that the necessary technical preconditions are in place. To encourage banks and other counterparties to prepare early, the Eurosystem will run tests of the limits regime ahead of its actual implementation. Further details, including the timeline, will be communicated in due course.
Additionally, the Eurosystem will, as of this year, consider climate change risks when reviewing haircuts applied to corporate bonds used as collateral. Haircuts are reductions applied to the value of collateral based on its riskiness.
In any case, all measures will ensure that ample collateral remains available, allowing monetary policy to continue to be implemented effectively.
Climate-related disclosure requirements for collateral: The Eurosystem will only accept marketable assets and credit claims from companies and debtors that comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations (once the directive is fully implemented). As the implementation of the CSRD has been delayed, the new eligibility criteria are expected to apply as of 2026.
This requirement will apply to all companies within the scope of the CSRD. It will help improve disclosures and generate better data for financial institutions, investors and civil society.
To encourage stakeholders to align with the new rules early on, the ECB will run test exercises one year ahead of actual implementation.
However, a significant proportion of the assets that can be pledged as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations, such as asset-backed securities and covered bonds, do not fall under the CSRD. To ensure a proper assessment of climate-related financial risks for those assets as well, the Eurosystem supports better and harmonised disclosures of climate-related data for them and, acting as a catalyst, engages closely with the relevant authorities to make this happen.
Risk assessment and management: The Eurosystem will further enhance its risk assessment tools and capabilities to better include climate-related risks. For example, ECB analysis has shown that, despite the progress already achieved by the rating agencies, current disclosure standards are not yet satisfactory.
To improve the external assessment of climate-related risks, the Eurosystem will urge rating agencies to be more transparent about how they incorporate climate risks into their ratings and to be more ambitious in their disclosure requirements on climate risks. The Eurosystem is in close dialogue with the relevant authorities on this matter.
Additionally, the Eurosystem agreed on a set of common minimum standards for how national central banks’ in-house credit assessment systems should include climate-related risks in their ratings. These standards will enter into force by the end of 2024.
Looking ahead, the Governing Council is committed to regularly reviewing all the measures outlined above. It will assess their effects and adapt them, if necessary: (1) to confirm that they continue to fulfil their monetary policy objectives; (2) to ensure – within its mandate – that the relevant measures continue to support the decarbonisation path to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement and the EU climate neutrality objectives; (3) to respond to future improvements in climate data and climate risk modelling or changes in regulation; and (4) to address additional environmental challenges, within its price stability mandate.
Companies and governments need to do their part to address climate risks by enhancing disclosures and following up on their commitments to reduce carbon emissions.
The decisions described above are part of the climate action plan announced in July 2021. The ECB’s work is progressing as outlined in the climate roadmap, and may have to be aligned if and when the timetable in EU legislation changes.
The ECB is also including climate change considerations in areas of its work besides monetary policy, including banking supervision, financial stability, economic analysis, statistical data and corporate sustainability. With this commitment, we aim to make a real difference in three ways: (1) by managing and mitigating the financial risk of climate change and assessing its economic impact, (2) by promoting sustainable finance to support an orderly transition towards a low-carbon economy and (3) by sharing our expertise to help foster wider changes in economic behaviour.
An overview of ongoing actions can be found in the ECB-wide climate agenda (see annex).

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-2021, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The annual data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector, comprising a broader set of data than the quarterly release. The end-December 2021 data refer to 317 banking groups and 2,477 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting of the European Banking Authority. However some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
As a consequence of the 2008 financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision strengthened its liquidity framework by developing, among other things, a minimum requirement for funding: the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). This ratio promotes a more resilient banking sector by encouraging banks to ensure funding resilience over the longer term, i.e. to fund long-term assets with long-term liabilities to reduce dependency on short-term refinancing.
A few revisions to past data are disclosed along with the end-December 2021 data.

Today the Governing Council met to exchange views on the current market situation. Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions.
Based on this assessment, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, the Governing Council decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council.

Euro remains second most widely used currency globally after US dollar
Euro’s share at around 19% across various indicators of international currency use
Euro’s global appeal linked to stronger Economic and Monetary Union
The international role of the euro remained stable in 2021, with its share across various indicators of international currency use averaging around 19%. This was one of the main findings in the annual review of The international role of the euro published today by the European Central Bank (ECB).
“Following the pandemic, the euro area has experienced one of the steepest recoveries in its history, thanks also to ample fiscal and monetary policy support. Now we face rising global inflation driven by higher energy costs, supply bottlenecks and normalising demand as economies reopen. On balance, however, these developments have not resulted in a significant change in the international role of the euro,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves increased by 0.5 percentage points to 20.6% in 2021, and the share of the euro in international bond issuance rose by almost 3 percentage points to 24.6%. Outstanding international loans and outstanding international deposits also increased markedly. However, the share of the euro in foreign exchange settlements declined. The share of the euro in the outstanding stock of international debt securities, as well as in invoicing of extra-euro imports and exports, remained broadly stable.
Looking ahead, the international role of the euro will be primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union, including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete Economic and Monetary Union.
This year’s interim edition of the report includes five analytical boxes. Box 1 discusses the implications for the international roles of the euro and the US dollar of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the financial sanctions imposed on Russia. “The Union’s economic and financial resilience to the current geopolitical challenges can also support the international role of the euro,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
Box 2 reviews recent developments in the international role of the Chinese renminbi. Box 3 provides insights into the international use of the euro as a financing currency across different economic sectors and the trends over time. Box 4 examines the interplay between the exchange rate elasticities of euro area external trade and the role of the euro as an invoicing currency.
Finally, Box 5 examines the role of the euro in the global market for stablecoins.

High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The Governing Council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term.
In May inflation again rose significantly, mainly because of surging energy and food prices, including due to the impact of the war. But inflation pressures have broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly. Eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly. These projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time. However, moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation. The new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022, before it is projected to decline to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024 – higher than in the March projections. This means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above the Governing Council’s target. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3.3% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024 – also above the March projections.
Russia’s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in Europe and beyond. It is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials, and is contributing to high energy and commodity prices. These factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth, especially in the near term. However, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic. Once current headwinds abate, economic activity is expected to pick up again. This outlook is broadly reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which foresee annual real GDP growth at 2.8% in 2022, 2.1% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. Compared with the March projections, the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and 2023, while for 2024 it has been revised up.
On the basis of its updated assessment, the Governing Council decided to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy. Throughout this process, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) as of 1 July 2022. The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
As concerns the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council undertook a careful review of the conditions which, according to its forward guidance, should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. As a result of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied.
Accordingly, and in line with the Governing Council’s policy sequencing, the Governing Council intends to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at its July monetary policy meeting. In the meantime, the Governing Council decided to leave the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
Looking further ahead, the Governing Council expects to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September. The calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. If the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at the September meeting.
Beyond September, based on its current assessment, the Governing Council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. In line with the Governing Council’s commitment to its 2% medium-term target, the pace at which the Governing Council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation to develop in the medium term.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced previously, the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III will end on 23 June 2022.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the ECB’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options
Financial market developments
Ms Schnabel reviewed the latest financial market developments. Since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 13-14 April 2022, there had been a major shift in monetary policy expectations and actions around the world as inflation had continued to surprise to the upside.
The main developments in financial markets revolved around four main themes. First, volatility in financial markets was high by historical standards, reflecting the longer than expected persistence of high inflation and the associated uncertainty about the extent and pace of monetary policy adjustment required to restore price stability over the medium term. Second, monetary policy normalisation in the euro area was expected to proceed at a significantly faster pace than at the time of the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting, with a rate lift-off expected in July. Third, expectations of a steeper policy path contributed to halting and partly reversing both the rise in inflation risk premia and the marked depreciation of the euro, thereby offsetting part of the renewed rise in oil prices. Fourth, changes in monetary policy expectations had brought the valuations of riskier assets closer to their long-term averages, in both fixed income and stock markets.
The increase in volatility witnessed globally over the previous few months had been reflected in higher implied volatility across virtually all main asset classes: bonds, equities and foreign exchange. The higher volatility went hand in hand with a deterioration in market liquidity. While such volatility was not surprising at turning points in monetary policy, its magnitude had been amplified by the combination of shocks hitting the world economy: the war in Ukraine, the energy transition, global excess demand and China’s zero-COVID policy.
Three sources of policy uncertainty were behind the current volatility: (i) the extent of the required policy adjustment, (ii) the pace of the policy adjustment, and (iii) the transmission of changes in policy rates to market interest rates and bank lending rates.
Regarding the first source of uncertainty, related to the extent of the required policy adjustment in the euro area and other major currency areas, investors had significantly repriced expected terminal rates – the peak interest rates expected by markets at the end of the normalisation or tightening cycle not corrected for term premia. This strong repricing of terminal rates had been a major factor in the recent increase in nominal long-term bond yields. While, in 2021, the rise in nominal ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates had been driven by rising inflation compensation, the real ten-year rate had increased markedly in 2022.
Market feedback suggested that the uncertainty about the extent of policy normalisation was driven by two main factors: uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate, and hence the level of the equilibrium real rate of interest, and uncertainty about the need to take policy rates above the neutral rate.
The second source of uncertainty, which related to the pace of policy adjustment, meant markets had not only repriced the terminal rate but were also expecting a significantly swifter policy normalisation than at the time of the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting. Surveys continued to lag market prices.
The pace of policy adjustment expected by investors was dependent on the perceived degree of anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations. Survey-based measures of inflation expectations gave different indications regarding the risks of unanchoring, depending on the underlying sample.
Market-based measures of long-term inflation compensation had declined from their decade-high level recorded in April but had started to rise again lately and remained above 2%. These developments reflected markets’ changing views on the likelihood of a recession, in particular market expectations of a resilient growth outlook, as well as the ECB’s communication pointing towards a rate lift-off in July. The ECB’s communication had been an important factor behind the decline in inflation risk premia at longer horizons, as it emphasised the commitment to protect price stability.
The third source of uncertainty in financial markets related to the expected strength of the transmission of changes in the key ECB interest rates to money market and bank lending rates. The weaker the expected transmission, the stronger and swifter the required policy adjustment in the eyes of investors. The strength of policy transmission also depended on the extent and expected pace of a decline in excess liquidity.
Excess liquidity was now expected to decline more slowly than previously assumed. This was because higher expectations of a prospective rise in the key ECB interest rates would lead banks to postpone repayment of the funds from targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).
Changes in policy rate expectations had been transmitted to broader financial markets. Equities had sold off as expected, coming down from the elevated levels that had been underpinned by historically low real interest rates. At the same time, since the 13-14 April monetary policy meeting, euro area stock markets had outperformed other indices despite expectations of a steeper policy path.
In euro area fixed income markets, spreads had continued to widen as markets repriced the future path of policy. Despite challenging liquidity conditions and elevated volatility, neither sovereign bond markets nor corporate bond markets had seen excessive moves. However, there had been a marked differentiation across issuers. Spreads had increased the most in Italy and Greece, where debt-to-GDP ratios were highest, and for corporate high-yield issuers, for whom credit risk was the largest. Spreads had increased less in Spain and Portugal and for corporate investment grade issuers.
Although expectations of monetary policy tightening had firmed almost everywhere, the euro had appreciated visibly against the currencies of many advanced economies since the Governing Council’s meeting on 13-14 April. The US dollar was the most notable exception.
The marked and persistent depreciation of the euro against the US dollar, the currency in which oil imports were predominately invoiced, had tangible and immediate effects on inflation, and therefore on inflation expectations. Since May 2021, oil prices had increased by 88% in US dollar terms but by 111% in euro terms. At the same time, the ECB’s communication since the start of the year had provided a counterweight to the downward pressure on the euro that had resulted primarily from the forceful action of the Federal Reserve System.
All in all, the outlook for inflation and hence for monetary policy would remain a key driver of asset prices for the foreseeable future. In this context, higher volatility was a natural reflection of price discovery in an environment in which central banks found it harder to provide clear forward guidance given the uncertainty around the policy outlook.
The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area
Mr Lane went through the latest economic, monetary and financial developments in the global economy and the euro area. Starting with the international environment, there had been a noticeable slowdown in the global trade of goods in the first quarter of 2022. The most recent data for March pointed to the contraction being largely driven by developments in China. As lockdown measures there had continued into the second quarter, it was likely that the loss of global trade momentum would persist. The war in Ukraine and the lockdown in China had interrupted the easing in global supply pressures in March. In the euro area, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) delivery times had deteriorated in March, but in May there was some improvement.
Looking at exchange rates, the euro was marginally weaker against the US dollar, while it had appreciated slightly in nominal effective terms since the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting. Oil prices had increased notably since the April meeting. The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area were therefore based on higher oil prices, but the slope of the futures curve remained negative. Other commodity prices had moderated since the meeting, with gas, metals and food prices declining. The June staff projections had seen a significant downward revision of world growth, with the projection for 2022 down from 4.1% to 3.0%. The lower projected growth implied a downward revision of euro area foreign demand, especially in 2023.
Turning to the euro area, real GDP had grown by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2022 according to Eurostat’s latest estimate. However, excluding Ireland, euro area GDP was up by only 0.3%. The contribution of domestic demand to euro area growth had been negative, amid the lockdowns at the start of the quarter and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.
The June staff projections had revised the quarterly GDP profile down but still embodied a significant recovery over the summer and into the fourth quarter. Short-term estimates were subject to high uncertainty for the rest of the year. The projections had generally been within the range of the available short-term forecasting tools, but the range of these estimates was wide on account of the high uncertainty. Indicators of uncertainty had risen sharply following the outbreak of the war, especially for manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, services. The PMI composite indicator was still above 50, but the PMI for manufacturing output had fallen as the indicator of services business activity had risen.
With regard to private consumption, households were increasingly feeling the squeeze on their real incomes from rising energy and food prices. The Consumer Expectations Survey showed that households did not expect to be able to maintain consumption in real terms. The survey also pointed to a reduction in saving flows.
Housing investment was affected by a jump in input costs. Construction used materials that relied on imported commodities. As a result, shortages of materials and equipment continued to accumulate in the construction sector. Rising construction costs were expected to put a break on growth in housing investment. The Consumer Expectations Survey indicated that the perceived attractiveness of housing as an investment was decreasing. The elevated uncertainty was expected to weigh on housing investment over the course of the year.
Data on capital goods production had shown a significant recovery at the end of 2021 with the rebound in car production. Following the outbreak of the war, however, production in the sector had seen little progress.
The euro area goods trade balance had deteriorated owing to the rising cost of imported energy and food. The overall trade balance had deteriorated by about 4 percentage points since the start of 2021, of which about 2.5 percentage points was due to the energy and food balance. This captured the real income cost of having to pay more money to the rest of the world.
A key reason for the good third-quarter prospects was tourism, by far the sector hit hardest by the pandemic. All available indicators were pointing to a very strong recovery, with expectations for demand in the summer months well above their pre-pandemic levels.
For the labour market, the evidence suggested that the very good recovery had continued in the first quarter of 2022. Growth in employment was overall consistent with a return to the pre-pandemic relationship between GDP and employment, after the break caused by the pandemic and the support measures put in place. This also meant that the recovery in economic activity currently explained most of the recovery in employment. The unemployment rate had declined again in April, in particular in countries such as Spain, where the recovery in tourism had helped to create jobs. Survey data continued to signal favourable labour market developments.
Turning to fiscal policies, the June staff projections had incorporated a significant amount of new support measures related to the war and compensation for energy price increases. These new measures amounted to roughly 1% of GDP for the euro area as a whole, with the figure varying across countries. GDP growth was expected to be supported mainly in 2022, as some of the measures were likely to be withdrawn later in the forecast horizon. Their impact on inflation was expected to be on the downside in 2022 and to largely reverse in 2023, owing to the temporary nature of the energy compensation measures. In terms of euro area fiscal balances, a gradual rolling back of the deficit continued to be expected, although the new projections signalled slower progress than foreseen in March. Nonetheless, thanks to the higher nominal GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio was still expected to decline despite higher interest payments.
Moving on to the latest inflation developments, headline inflation had increased further in May, with the largest contribution again from energy. All categories of energy inflation, not only fuel, were important factors behind the evolution of energy inflation. However, the contributions of all categories of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had increased. The May outcomes for both headline HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy and food were above the June staff projections. While forecast errors were made in all components, the largest was in food inflation.
The intensification of pipeline pressures was one reason for the upward revision of the inflation projections for 2023 and, to some extent, for 2024. Pipeline pressures could take a long time to be transmitted to headline inflation, but one of the key uncertainties was that there could currently be a faster pass-through because of the scale of the increases in pipeline pressures. At the same time, a faster pass-through could also mean a shorter adjustment period afterwards, so that the pass-through could lead to a stronger effect on inflation in the near term, but a weaker effect once the price level had adjusted.
Core inflation had clearly risen. Continued analysis was needed of those components of core inflation that were moving up. It was often the case that all components of core inflation rose together, which could be described as a general inflation impulse. By contrast, current core inflation was essentially characterised by a lot of relative price movements as a result of the reopening of certain sectors.
For goods inflation, staff analysis showed that energy prices and bottlenecks accounted for about 0.8 percentage points and 1 percentage point of the increase respectively. However, goods inflation might also have been affected by the green transition. The recovery in domestic demand was also playing a role. Services inflation was not developing in the same way across all sectors. Contact-intensive sectors were contributing the most to the increase in services inflation. The oil-sensitive services sectors were also seeing a large increase in their contributions to services inflation, suggesting that energy was also having significant indirect effects on services inflation. Overall, the reopening of the economy and energy price increases explained much of the dynamics in services inflation.
Moving to wages, growth in negotiated wages had seen a considerable increase in the first quarter, largely owing to one-off payments. When excluding these, the increase was considerably more moderate. The forward-looking wage tracker for the euro area, which was an aggregation of data for four of the euro area’s five largest economies, indicated that wage growth obtained on the basis of what had been negotiated this year and covering also next year was around 3% in 2022 and 2.6% in 2023. This represented an increase from the current figure for negotiated wages, but the increase was well below what Eurosystem staff were projecting in terms of aggregate wage dynamics. Wage expectations remained contained according to the Consumer Expectations Survey.
Looking at how firms were coping with the spike in costs, unit profits had weakened significantly in the first quarter of 2022, after increasing steadily during 2021. This seemed to suggest that rising input costs meant that unit profits had to absorb them. The latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises indicated – based on qualitative replies – that firms in most industries expected to increase their selling prices over the next 12 months. This applied, in particular, to those sectors that had seen the highest cost increases, namely construction, industry and trade, while the share of respondents expecting higher increases in services was smaller.
Turning to the assumptions in the June staff projections, Mr Lane noted that, compared with the December 2021 staff projections, the oil price was almost 40% higher. At the same time, the trade-weighted exchange rate of the euro for 2022 was currently 1.4% weaker, while the exchange rate against the US dollar was four times weaker than the trade-weighted exchange rate. Long-term yields were also 116 basis points higher for 2022 than expected last December, and short-term yields were 44 basis points higher. Developments in oil and exchange rates had played a major role in inflation forecast errors, but the inflation rate would have been even higher without the tightening of assumptions that had taken place in 2022. The June staff projections also contained a wealth of sensitivity analyses and a downside scenario. This was a way to capture non-linearities.
Regarding financial developments, since the 13-14 April Governing Council meeting euro area risk-free rates had increased further as market participants revised their expectations of an earlier tightening of monetary policy. However, correcting the forward curve for risk premia gave indications similar to those in the latest Survey of Monetary Analysis. It was important to note that, in the course of 2022, a significant increase and steepening of real interest rates could be observed. Since the Governing Council meeting on 15-16 December, looking at the term structure of real forward rates, there had been a 1.5-percentage point increase in real forward rates at the very long end for the one-year forward rate nine years ahead contract. From the two-year forward rate contract onwards, there had been an increase in real rates of around 1 percentage point or more.
With regard to inflation expectations, those reflected in the Survey of Monetary Analysts had previously fallen to below 2% for 2024 but were now expected to be at 2% from 2024 onwards and to stay there durably. So this survey was closely aligned with the view that inflation would come down to close to target in 2024 and stay there. Market-based measures of inflation compensation still saw inflation peaking in the very near term and declining across maturities thereafter. Price-level effects were permanent, but it remained the case that market participants envisaged a sizeable reduction in inflation dynamics.
Masked by the recent slight decline, longer-term measures of inflation compensation, such as the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, had temporarily increased well above target since the last meeting. Estimates of genuine inflation expectations at the five-year horizon five years ahead – obtained by purging plain market data of inflation risk premia – had also increased recently. These estimates, including those from new models with a shifting endpoint, now stood closer to – but still below – 2%, amid high model uncertainty. Allowing for the treatment of risk premia, the expectation that inflation would come back to the target remained the narrative. However, the inflation risk premium was capturing the upside risks.
For consumer inflation expectations three years ahead, the Consumer Expectations Survey for April pointed to a slight decline since March, with the median down from 2.9% to 2.7%. In May, there was a further slight decrease to 2.5%. At the same time, the results indicated heightened uncertainty.
Moving to lending to firms and households, flows remained positive. Credit growth to firms had remained positive, but that was partly a rotation away from bond issuance, which had become more expensive than bank borrowing. The picture for households was mixed, as there had been some recovery in credit for consumption but still not to the pre-pandemic level. It remained the case that, in aggregate, households still had a lot of savings.
On financing costs, so far bank lending rates and credit conditions had, by and large, been insulated from the increase in market rates. This was explained by the fact that deposit rates remained low and deposit funding remained readily available, as people were still holding a lot of money in deposits.
Mortgage rates were picking up more in some countries than in others, displaying some correlation with sovereign yields and with bank deposit rates, although there had not yet been a significant pass-through. There were so far no strong signs of a big slowdown in mortgage lending, but this picture might change rapidly, as in some countries mortgage rates had already moved significantly.
Monetary policy considerations and policy options
In summary, Mr Lane stressed that there had been a further significant increase of 8.1% in HICP inflation in May, up from 7.4% in April. HICP inflation excluding energy and food had increased to 3.8%, from 3.5% in April. The higher rate reflected a rise in both non-energy industrial goods inflation, from 3.8% to 4.2%, and services inflation, from 3.3% to 3.5%. So far, negotiated wage growth in the euro area had remained moderate, especially when excluding one-off payments. The forward-looking wage tracker that incorporated the latest wage settlements showed an uptick in nominal wage increases but still at a moderate pace. Nevertheless, wage formation warranted careful monitoring, particularly in a context in which the labour market had become tighter and some countries were implementing increases in minimum wages.
The future path of headline inflation had been revised up significantly in the June staff projections, especially for the near term. These projections indicated that inflation would remain undesirably elevated for still some time. Over the projection horizon, wage growth was now expected to rise to levels well above the historical average. HICP inflation was projected to stand at 6.8% in 2022 (1.7 percentage points higher than in the March staff projections), before declining to 3.5% in 2023 (1.4 percentage points higher) and further to 2.1% in 2024 (0.2 percentage points higher). This meant that headline inflation in the final year of the projection horizon was projected to be slightly above target. The decline over the projection horizon reflected the moderation in energy and food commodity prices that was embedded in current futures prices, the fading of pandemic effects, a gradual easing of supply bottlenecks and the normalisation of monetary policy.
HICP inflation excluding energy and food had also been revised up over the entire projection horizon. It was now expected to be 3.3% in 2022 (0.7 percentage points higher than in the March staff projections), 2.8% in 2023 (1.0 percentage point higher) and 2.3% in 2024 (0.4 percentage points higher). The upward revision reflected the ongoing reopening of the economy, especially in some services, the re-emergence of some supply disruptions, tightening labour markets and a pick-up in wage increases. At the same time, core inflation was expected to decline over the projection horizon owing to the fading impact of the pandemic, the easing of bottlenecks and the indirect contribution of the current surge in energy prices falling away. The assumption that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and the rising level of market interest rates throughout the projection horizon also contributed to a sustained decline in headline inflation towards the ECB’s target by the end of 2024.
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys stood at around 2%. At the same time, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warranted close monitoring.
Risks to inflation projections were primarily on the upside, especially in relation to 2022 and 2023. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable worsening of the production capacity of the economy, higher energy and food prices, longer-term inflation expectations rising above the ECB’s target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.
Turning to the growth forecast in the June staff projections, countervailing forces had resulted in a marked downward revision to real GDP growth for 2022 and 2023. Real GDP growth was now expected to be 2.8% in 2022 (0.9 percentage points lower than in the March staff projections) and 2.1% in 2023 (0.7 percentage points lower). However, stronger growth, at 2.1%, was expected in 2024 owing to catch-up effects (0.5 percentage points higher than in the March staff projections). Taken together, the revisions implied a lower level of GDP throughout the projection horizon.
Risks relating to the pandemic had declined but the war continued to be a significant downside risk to growth. In particular, a major risk would be a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area, as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections. Furthermore, if the war were to escalate, economic sentiment could worsen, supply-side constraints could increase, and energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected.
Markets had priced in a sequence of ECB rate hikes. Increases in risk-free rates had been amplified in euro area sovereign bond yields and corporate bond yields, while bank lending rates were also starting to rise. Lower equity prices had also contributed to a tightening in financial conditions.
On the basis of this updated assessment, it was appropriate to take further steps in normalising monetary policy:
First, the Governing Council should announce that net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) would end as of 1 July. This would be consistent with communication after the March and April meetings and in line with the stated sequencing, i.e. the prior action opening the door to a first rate hike at the July meeting. Furthermore, the Governing Council should reiterate and update its forward guidance on the length of the horizon for full reinvestment under the APP. Rather than referring to the need to maintain “favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation”, which up to now had been the Governing Council’s language on the reinvestment period, it should state the need to ensure “ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance”.
Second, the Governing Council should communicate that it saw the conditions of its forward guidance on raising the ECB’s policy rates as satisfied. The first condition of the forward guidance stated that inflation should be seen reaching the target of 2% well ahead of the end of the projection horizon. The second condition required inflation to be stabilising at that level durably for the rest of the projection horizon. In fact, the June staff projections saw inflation exceeding the target by a wide margin in 2023 and, more moderately, for a substantial part of 2024. The third condition stipulated that the realised progress in underlying inflation needed to be judged as sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. The most recent data confirmed that underlying inflation dynamics were strengthening and broadening. First, core inflation was expected to stand above target over the entire projection horizon – albeit on a declining path. Second, a wide range of statistical filters, used to extract the underlying common factor and time trend explaining price changes cross-sectionally and over time, suggested that inflation dynamics were not likely to return to the pre-pandemic below-target configuration. Third, the latest wage settlements were also in line with a stronger trend consistent with inflation stabilising at the target in the medium term.
Accordingly, and in line with the ECB’s policy sequencing, the Governing Council should express its intention to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at its monetary policy meeting in July. The Governing Council should also state that it expected to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September and signal that the scale of the rate increase in September would depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook.
There were several factors justifying the signal that the intended first increment in July should be 25 basis points. First, a moderate initial increase was most likely to foster a continuing orderly market adjustment amid high uncertainty. Second, longer-term inflation expectations remained anchored at the ECB’s target. Third, based on a yield curve that reflected underlying expectations of a gradual but sustained sequence of rate increases over 2022 and 2023, inflation was projected to return close to target in 2024. Fourth, the most effective way to manage the upside risks to medium-term inflation was to be clear about the ECB’s reaction function. This meant communicating that larger increments or a faster sequence of moderate rate increases would be appropriate if such risks intensified or materialised. Given the current projections and the high degree of uncertainty, a larger, pre-emptive initial increment ran the risk of triggering excessive adjustments in market interest rates. That could be counterproductive, especially if the upside risks failed to materialise. Moreover, in terms of inflation dynamics, which in any event would only be affected with a considerable lag, deferring a larger increment to a subsequent meeting would not make a material difference.
These considerations suggested that a 25-basis point increment was a proportionate first step. In addition, opening the door to a larger increment in September would also allow the Governing Council to benefit from an updated set of projections and from observing the impact of the first rate hike on financial conditions over the summer. This step-by-step approach to interest rate adjustment during the third quarter would signal determination to exit the negative rate policy expeditiously, while also reasserting the value of optionality in a context fraught with multiple sources of risk. More generally, the Governing Council should be clear that the future path of policy interest rates would be data-dependent and determined by its commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.
Looking beyond the third quarter, the Governing Council should signal that, based on its current assessment, it anticipated that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates would be appropriate. The pace at which the Governing Council adjusted its monetary policy would depend on the incoming data and how the Governing Council assessed inflation to develop in the medium term. If the medium-term inflation outlook were to deteriorate, the pace of rate increases would accelerate. Likewise, if the medium-term inflation outlook were to moderate, the pace would be slower. Throughout this process, gradualism, flexibility, optionality and data-dependence would be important considerations in setting out the path for interest rates. The likelihoods of the different scenarios would depend – among other factors – on how quickly current price pressures abated, the evolution of excess capacity and the degree to which inflation expectations continued to remain anchored at the ECB’s target.
Finally, the Governing Council should confirm that, as announced previously, the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III would end on 23 June 2022.
The sequential plan had several attractive elements.
First, ending net asset purchases before raising rates would avoid the ECB’s monetary policy instruments working in opposite directions, thereby mitigating volatility and minimising financial stability risks. Moving sequentially would allow the Governing Council to observe how the market adjusted to the end of the net asset purchases and to this pivot in the process of policy normalisation.
Second, what mattered most for the monetary policy stance was not so much the level of the overnight interest rate at present but the path that the rate was expected to follow over the coming months and years. A moderate hike at lift-off had the additional benefit that it would foster an orderly adjustment in financing conditions, reducing volatility.
Finally, flexibility would help the Governing Council to ensure the smooth and even transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy across the entire euro area during the process of policy normalisation.
In line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council should also use the present meeting to consider its biannual assessment of the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. On the evidence available, from a financial stability perspective, the environment had worsened since December 2021 – the most recent review period – especially in the short term. In particular, lower growth and increasing cost pressures, as well as rising risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields, could lead to a further deterioration in the financing conditions faced by borrowers, especially in some countries. At the same time, tighter financing conditions could reduce some existing financial stability vulnerabilities over the medium term. Banks, which had started the year with solid capital positions and improving asset quality, were now facing greater credit risk. The Governing Council would watch these factors closely. In any case, macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.
2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions
Economic, monetary and financial analyses
As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane that global trade had seen an important loss of momentum in the first quarter of 2022, mainly as a result of developments in China. The war in Ukraine and the lockdown in China had halted the gradual easing of global supply pressures that had started at the end of 2021. In this respect, it was important to monitor the latest data for signs that easing could have resumed. At the same time, concern was expressed that surges in inflation were being observed across many economic areas. Members saw important differences, however, with price pressures in the United States more related to overheating domestic demand and those in the euro area reflecting, to a larger extent, imported inflation.
Turning to euro area developments, activity was expected to be dampened by high energy costs, the deterioration in the terms of trade, greater uncertainty and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income. Firms faced higher costs and renewed disruptions in their supply chains, and their outlook for future output had deteriorated. However, there were also factors supporting economic activity and these were expected to strengthen over the months to come. The reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market, with more people in jobs, would continue to support incomes and consumption. Unemployment remained at its historical low of 6.8% in April and job vacancies across many sectors showed that there was robust demand for labour. In addition, savings accumulated during the pandemic were a buffer. Members noted that economic growth and employment had remained surprisingly robust given the size of the supply shocks. It was cautioned that the stronger than expected quarter-on-quarter growth in euro area real GDP in the first quarter of the year had been driven, to a large extent, by a higher contribution from inventory changes that was likely to unwind. Domestic demand excluding inventory changes had contracted in the first quarter.
Looking at the June staff projections, the question was raised whether the assumptions behind the baseline were too benign in terms of the impact of the sanctions and the war. Doubts were also expressed concerning the assumption, in these same projections, that the saving ratio would unwind less and no longer implied a reduction in previously accumulated savings. The question was also raised whether consumers would start tapping their savings more heavily to cope with the loss of purchasing power or they would reallocate their savings into real assets.
Members widely acknowledged the resilience of the labour market. This implied that the unemployment gap would close much earlier than the output gap, which was puzzling given that the labour market was typically a lagging indicator. It was observed that the size of the output gap had been revised down significantly, while there had been hardly any revision to potential output despite the additional supply shocks, and it was thus suspected that the output gap could also be smaller and close faster. At the same time, it was argued that the current resilience of the labour market reflected a number of factors that made it unlikely to be permanent, such as public employment, temporary jobs and job retention schemes. This implied the risk that there would eventually be a deterioration in employment.
Members broadly agreed with the downside risks to economic activity that the staff projections anticipated in the near term. Risks relating to the pandemic had declined but the war continued to be a significant downside risk to growth. In particular, a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area would be a major risk, as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections. Furthermore, if the war were to escalate, economic sentiment could worsen, supply-side constraints could increase, and energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected. In this context, it was emphasised that the downside risks were not only related to the negative cost shocks but also to the impact of uncertainty on demand. Moreover, there was still a risk that the pandemic could restart. While the medium-term outlook for growth looked balanced in terms of risks, the next few quarters would be weak and the risk of a technical recession needed to be borne in mind. However, it was generally considered that stagflation was an unlikely outcome.
Members agreed that fiscal policies were helping to cushion the impact of the war. Targeted and temporary budgetary measures protected those people bearing the brunt of higher energy prices while limiting the risk of adding to inflationary pressures. The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme, the “Fit for 55” package and the REPowerEU plan would also help the euro area economy to grow faster in a sustainable manner and become more resilient to global shocks. It was suggested that fiscal measures compensating for high energy prices would likely continue if energy prices remained high. At the same time, further fiscal support would, in any case, have negative implications for public debt. In this respect, it was warned that not all fiscal measures were well targeted and temporary.
On price developments, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane in his introduction. Inflation had risen further to 8.1% in May. Although governments had intervened and had helped to slow energy inflation, energy prices stood 39.2% above their 2021 levels. Market-based indicators suggested that global energy prices would stay high in the near term but then moderate to some extent. Year-on-year food prices had risen by 7.5% in May, in part reflecting the importance of Ukraine and Russia among the main global producers of agricultural goods. Prices had generally also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks and a recovery in domestic demand as the economy reopened, especially in the services sector. Price rises were becoming more widespread across sectors and, accordingly, measures of underlying inflation had been rising further. Wage growth, including in forward-looking indicators, had started to pick up. Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-up effects should lead to faster growth in wages.
It was noted that May was the tenth month in a row in which the inflation figure had been underestimated. Reference was made to the fact that a mechanical update of the June staff projections with the May numbers would imply a level of inflation 0.3 percentage points higher for 2022 as a whole. At the same time, it was observed that most of the recent inflation projection errors could be explained by the direct and indirect effects of under-predictions of energy and food price rises, rather than by an underlying change in agents’ behaviour. Such errors could be explained by the difficulty in forecasting supply shocks. At the same time, it was argued that energy and food shocks appeared to be more persistent than previously thought and that this was not just a consequence of the war in Ukraine, because inflation had gained momentum before the outbreak of conflict. Moreover, it was pointed out that the inflation rates for services and non-energy industrial goods had also surprised on the upside and that none of the increases in core inflation every month so far this year had been anticipated. Inflationary pressures from re-opening in the tourism sector, which had been prominent in the May figures, were likely to continue in the coming months as tourism opened up more widely.
Core inflation had reached almost 4% in May and indicators of underlying inflation continued to increase markedly, standing between 3% and 6%. This indicated that price pressures were broadening and becoming more persistent. In terms of absolute deviations, currently the upside deviation of core inflation from the inflation target was much larger than it had been on the downside at any time during the period when monetary policy had focused on deflation risks. It was also emphasised that core inflation was projected to remain above 2% over the entire horizon in the June staff projections. At the same time, it was argued that measures of underlying inflation had to be interpreted carefully, as they were also affected by unusual transitory forces such as the indirect effects of the energy shocks, the re-opening and supply bottlenecks. For example, taking the indirect effects of energy prices out of the core inflation projection would result in a 2.0% projection for core inflation in 2024.
Members broadly agreed that wage developments played a central role in the current inflation outlook. Reference was made to the usefulness of the so-called wage tracker, which afforded a more forward-looking perspective on negotiated wage growth. That measure confirmed that negotiated wages were increasing by around 3-4%. However, it was argued that one-off payments, which had been behind the latest pick-up in negotiated wages, should not be seen as a sign of second-round effects and incipient wage-price spirals. At the same time, the wage tracker was suggesting that increasingly tight labour markets were starting to translate into higher wage demands. Mention was also made of greater recourse to wage indexation in some countries, also in the context of European legislation for a minimum wage. This was seen as a particular concern for the potential emergence of wage-price spirals. It was also noted that the wage tracker did not account for those negotiations that would only take place at the end of the year and could then change the forward-looking picture.
The point was made that, ultimately, it was necessary to look beyond negotiated wage growth and consider all elements affecting actual wage growth. Caution was also expressed about looking only at nominal wage growth, as growth in unit labour costs was ultimately the more relevant indicator for inflation trends and showed only modest dynamics. In this regard, it was remarked that wage growth, while currently contained, was projected to run slightly higher than the sum of productivity growth and the inflation target over the coming years. It was also stressed that the current reduction in real wages could lead to upward pressures on nominal wages going forward.
In their discussion of the June staff projections members highlighted the further large upward revisions to the inflation outlook, particularly in 2022 and 2023, and raised a number of questions about the future path of inflation. It was observed that the inflation path in the current baseline resembled that of the adverse scenario in the March staff projections. It was also underlined that the last time headline inflation had been above 2% in the final year of the projection horizon was 2007, while core inflation had never been above 2% at that horizon. Reference was made to the latest OECD forecast, which showed a higher level of core inflation in the euro area that persisted for longer and stood at 4%, on average, for both 2022 and 2023.
Given the steeply downward-sloping future path of both headline and core inflation, the view was once again expressed that this was likely the result of the assumption that shocks were transitory combined with model dynamics being mean-reverting. Such “built-in” convergence neglected the issue of successive adverse shocks and the possibility of greater persistence and/or non-linear behaviour, which were currently the main challenges to the inflation outlook.
With the tendency of the projections to strongly converge to target in the last year of the horizon, the projection for that year was seen as having limited information content. Moreover, as core inflation was also higher than headline inflation in 2024, this was seen as a signal of upside risks to headline inflation for 2024 and beyond, as core inflation typically captured more persistent components of inflation relevant for medium-term trends. It was also recalled that, if owner-occupied housing was fully taken into account, core inflation would likely be even higher. Moreover, the remark was made that a normalisation of monetary policy according to the rate path currently priced by markets, which was already included in the technical assumptions, would not be sufficient to bring inflation back to 2% over the medium term according to the baseline projection.
At the same time, it was argued that a succession of supply shocks suggested a lengthening, rather than a shortening of the relevant policy horizon, when aiming to maintain price stability over the medium term. It was also recalled that the ECB’s strategy review in 2021 had confirmed that it targeted headline, rather than core inflation, as the relevant yardstick for monetary policy. It was underlined that the future path of inflation in the June staff projections was not so different from that foreseen by many other forecasters in the private sector and by international institutions.
Overall, it was widely acknowledged that uncertainty was high and that the transmission of the current inflation shock and its potential persistence into 2023 and 2024 needed to be better understood. The baseline in the staff projections was seen as potentially too benign, despite substantial upward revisions to the inflation outlook. The historically high level of core inflation pointed to increasing risks of higher inflation becoming more entrenched and persistent. Pipeline pressures were also seen to be continuing to build up, with the odds of a stronger and quicker pass-through to consumer prices increasing. At the same time, it was stressed that risks existed in both directions and, in any case, when considering the inflation outlook, the Governing Council would take both the baseline and the configuration of risks into account.
Regarding the assumptions underlying the projections, it was noted that energy and commodity prices themselves might be seen as likely to rise further, or at least stay higher for longer, in contrast to the downward-sloping path of the futures curve embedded in the projections. This technical assumption had been one of the main reasons for forecast errors in the past. Moreover, structural shifts such as climate change might exert more lasting upward pressure on energy and food prices. This could lead to headline inflation exceeding core inflation by a much larger margin than observed historically, casting further doubt on the plausibility of headline inflation falling below core inflation in 2024, as embedded in the projections. On the fiscal side, it was argued that government support measures could reinforce inflation pressures if they turned out to be less targeted and less temporary than envisaged, at a time of generally high pressures on resources and mismatches between supply and demand. Additionally, supply bottlenecks might prove more protracted than assumed in the baseline scenario. Attention was drawn to the ongoing rotation between bottlenecks in goods, which were expected to ease, and those in services, which had just been emerging and would gain more prominence as households rebalanced their consumption from goods to services.
Medium-term inflation pressures could also be higher than assumed in the projections if potential economic growth suffered more lasting damage from successive supply shocks and the war in Ukraine. Questions were raised as to the reliability and stability of the Phillips curve relationship since behavioural economics indicated that collective psychology might change rapidly when there were threshold effects and possible non-linearities. It was remarked that the longer inflation stayed elevated, the greater the risk of second-round effects via higher wages and/or higher profit margins. According to the projections, 2024 would be the fourth consecutive year of inflation above 2%, which suggested rising risks of second-round effects and of higher inflation becoming entrenched over time. The spending power of households might also turn out to be higher than assumed in the projections, where the saving ratio had been revised up on the expectation of higher precautionary saving. The projections foresaw no drawing down of savings in nominal terms – notwithstanding ”forced dissaving” in real terms – to maintain consumption in the face of higher and unanticipated inflation. Accordingly, firms’ pricing power could be higher than projected and they could use the current reopening of the economy to restore profit margins and increase the pass-through of costs to consumer prices, instead of absorbing higher costs by accepting lower margins. Reference was also made to the period following the financial crisis, during which profit margins had increased even in a downturn in a number of euro area economies with weak corporate balance sheets.
At the same time it was underlined that, at present, no second-round effects or wage-price spirals could be observed and that there were indications that unions would be cautious with wage claims to preserve employment at a time of renewed uncertainty. This caution would help avoid derailing a strong labour market, which had been a source of income stability in Europe throughout the pandemic.
While there was wide agreement that market-derived indicators of inflation expectations were broadly anchored at around the target level, it was widely felt that there was no room for complacency given the high costs of re-anchoring expectations. The risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was seen as particularly high when inflation expectations adapted to recent developments. Such a risk was considered as increasingly likely to materialise since HICP inflation was projected to stand above, and mostly far above, 2% for more than three years. Emphasis was placed on the importance of households’ and firms’ inflation expectations, which were more directly relevant for wage and pricing decisions. More generally, it was underlined that concerns over a loss of purchasing power were very pronounced among the general public all over Europe.
Against this background members assessed the risks surrounding inflation as primarily on the upside. The risk to the medium-term inflation outlook included a durable reduction in the production capacity of the economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.
Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, members largely concurred with the assessments provided by Ms Schnabel and Mr Lane in their introductions. Market interest rates had increased further in nominal terms since the Governing Council’s 13-14 April meeting in response to the changing outlook for inflation and monetary policy. Near-term real rates largely remained in negative territory close to historical lows, but the real forward curve had, overall, risen substantially over recent months. With benchmark interest rates rising, bank funding costs had increased, and this had fed into higher lending rates, in particular for households. Nevertheless, bank lending to firms had picked up in March, reflecting the continued need to finance investment and working capital, against the backdrop of increasing production costs, persistent supply bottlenecks and lower reliance on market funding. Lending to households had also increased, reflecting continued robust demand for mortgages. Euro area banks had started the year with solid capital positions and improving asset quality. So far, bank-based financing conditions for households and firms had, on the whole, remained relatively resilient to increases in market rates, notwithstanding growing signs of a turning point having been reached in bank borrowing costs for firms, after the historical lows seen in December.
Broader financial conditions had tightened considerably owing to rising bond yields and lower equity valuations, while the euro exchange rate had stabilised. At the same time, risk aversion was rising and investors were becoming more selective, as evidenced by rising risk premia in yields on lower-rated corporate and sovereign bonds. It was remarked that the scale and speed of recent yield spread increases for some countries, without major changes in country economic fundamentals, suggested that other factors might be at play, including non-linearities, multiple equilibria and factors of a political nature.
In line with the monetary policy strategy adopted in July 2021, the Governing Council held its regular biannual structured exchange on the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. Members concurred that the environment for financial stability had worsened since the last review in December 2021, especially over the short term. In particular, lower economic growth and increasing cost pressures, as well as rising risk-free rates and sovereign bond yields, could lead to a deterioration in the financing conditions faced by borrowers. In this context, there was agreement that monetary policy normalisation might affect financial stability at different horizons in opposite ways. Tighter financing conditions could reduce some financial stability vulnerabilities over the medium term, for example in residential real estate. At the same time, when interest rates were exiting a prolonged period in negative territory, monetary policy normalisation could be accompanied by short-term financial stress and increased fragmentation of financial conditions. Moreover, banks were facing greater credit risk in an environment of lower growth and heightened uncertainty. Looking ahead, these factors would need to be watched closely. In any case, macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.
Monetary policy stance and policy considerations
Turning to the assessment of the monetary policy stance, members agreed that the revised medium-term inflation outlook required further steps to be taken in normalising monetary policy. The latest Eurosystem staff projections saw headline and core inflation in the baseline scenario standing above 2% in 2024, and in the staff assessment risks to the inflation projections were tilted to the upside over the entire horizon, especially for 2022 and 2023. In this respect, it also had to be taken into account that the baseline projections were based on the assumption that monetary policy would be adjusted in line with market expectations at the cut-off date for the projections, with those expectations having shifted markedly upwards in recent months. It was underlined that the appropriate monetary policy response for the Governing Council to take depended on its assessment of the inflation outlook, which comprised both the baseline and the risk assessment. In view of the baseline inflation projection exceeding the ECB’s target at the relevant horizon, together with the large and persistent upside risks, it was suggested that the ECB needed to respond more strongly than implied by the market expectations for interest rates embedded in the staff projections.
Members agreed that it was imperative for the ECB to preserve its credibility by showing its resolve to make sure that inflation returned to its 2% inflation target over the medium term. On the one hand, credibility was perceived to have been called into question recently in the light of very high inflation, repeated projection errors and a narrative that had insisted on the temporary nature of inflation shocks for too long. Determined action was judged to be needed to protect the anchoring of inflation expectations and to avoid sizeable second-round effects, with inflation and wages feeding into one another. It was also argued that, if the monetary policy stance were normalised too slowly, monetary policy risked adding to demand pressures at a time when the economy was recovering from the pandemic and pressures on resources were already high. On the other hand, it was stressed that the ECB’s credibility was not in doubt as long as inflation expectations remained anchored and as long as no evidence of second-round effects could be seen. Moreover, the ECB should take confidence from the reputation it had earned in successfully combatting the risk of deflation in the past. Reference was made to survey evidence from the general public confirming that the ECB was not currently being blamed for the present episode of high energy inflation, given that the shock was seen as mainly related to rising food and energy costs and that the euro area was not experiencing excessive demand. At the same time, however, it was clear that the general public expected the ECB to take action and to live up to its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term.
Members concurred overall that most measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and expert surveys appeared to be still broadly anchored at the ECB’s target, notwithstanding initial signs of above-target revisions. While risks of an unanchoring had been increasing for some time, it was argued that, since April, there had been some reassuring developments in a number of the indicators, including a stabilisation in the euro exchange rate. On the whole, the evidence so far was seen to remain consistent with a successful re-anchoring of inflation expectations around the ECB’s target, in line with the new monetary policy strategy announced in 2021. This provided the Governing Council with grounds for a reasonable degree of self-confidence.
At the same time, it was cautioned that there was no room for complacency because, looking ahead, the anchoring of inflation expectations could not be taken for granted. Some measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at levels above the Governing Council’s inflation target. Moreover, the view was held that it would be much more costly to address a broad-based unanchoring of inflation expectations once it had materialised, as opposed to responding pre-emptively. On the one hand, it was argued that the experience gained in the 1970s, when different inflation outcomes across jurisdictions could be traced back to different central bank reaction functions, suggested that central banks that acted earlier achieved better inflation outcomes. On the other hand, it was maintained that the current environment differed from the 1970s in important respects, such as improved central bank transparency, weaker aggregate demand conditions, a lower degree of unionisation and a lower prevalence of wage-indexation clauses.
Monetary policy decisions and communication
Members broadly agreed that the monetary policy normalisation process should continue to be guided by the four principles of optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility. Different views, however, were expressed on the need for and the interpretation of gradualism, as well as on how in practice to reconcile gradualism with the need for data-dependence and optionality in an uncertain environment. The view was put forward that the notion of gradualism could be misleading if it was interpreted as implying too slow or too rigid a pace of adjustment in the monetary policy stance. Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the need for optionality and data-dependence. In particular, it was necessary to avoid gradualism being seen as precluding interest rate steps in excess of 25 basis points. Ensuring price stability over the medium term might, depending on changes in the inflation outlook and prevailing risks and circumstances, require more forceful and front-loaded responses to signal the determination to protect price stability. Moreover, it was argued that the principle of gradualism suggested responding early and in a forward-looking manner, which would then reduce the need for larger and more disruptive adjustments later. A remark was made that the merits of gradualism depended on the nature of uncertainty and shocks. In the light of a long sequence of persistent upward inflation surprises and an increasing risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations, the “Brainard principle”, i.e. that policymakers should act cautiously if there is uncertainty about the effects of monetary policy measures, no longer applied.
There was agreement that gradualism should not necessarily be interpreted as slow action in small steps. Therefore, members felt that the sustained succession of rate increases over the coming quarters – as reflected in the rate path embedded in market expectations and the staff projections – could be characterised as gradual. It was cautioned that dropping the notion of gradualism could be seen as a signal that the ECB intended to take abrupt action, which could undermine predictability and risked triggering disorderly market movements. Gradualism also was considered consistent with the medium-term orientation of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy and with the prevailing uncertainty on the growth outlook. This was deemed especially important in the face of supply shocks such as those faced by the euro area, and also since the euro area was more exposed to movements in energy prices than other currency areas. Overall, members agreed to retain gradualism as one of the four guiding principles for the monetary policy normalisation process, on the understanding that this did not rule out interest rate steps in increments larger than 25 basis points if and when needed to protect price stability over the medium term. The point was also made that the principles of optionality and data-dependence seemed to be essentially equivalent and were especially important in the present circumstances. In any case it was emphasised that the notion of gradualism should not interfere with the Governing Council’s duty to do – at all times –what was needed to maintain price stability over the medium term.
A number of members recalled that in their view, the three forward guidance criteria for interest rates established in July 2021 had been satisfied for some time. At the same time, the need to safeguard the coherence and predictability of ECB policy was acknowledged, which suggested sticking to the sequence previously communicated. However, it was suggested that the implied “delay” in raising interest rates should, in principle, be offset by implementing a larger rate hike in July or by indicating more explicitly the possibility of a larger interest rate move later in the third "

Number of offices continued to decline in most EU Member States, by 1.98% on average
Number of bank employees declined by 0.85% on average
Degree of banking sector concentration continues to differ widely across countries
The European Central Bank (ECB) has updated its dataset of structural financial indicators for the banking sector in the European Union (EU) for the end of 2021. This annual dataset comprises statistics on the number of offices and employees of EU credit institutions, data on the degree of concentration of the banking sector in each EU Member State and data on foreign-controlled institutions in EU national banking markets.
The structural financial indicators show a further decline in the number of bank offices in the EU, averaging 1.98% across Member States. Falls ranging from -0.2% to -22.93% were observed in 20 of the 27 countries. The total number of offices in the EU at the end of 2021 was 138,294, 82.56% of which were located in the euro area.
In the course of 2021, the number of employees of credit institutions fell in 21 EU Member States, with an average decline of 0.85% across all countries. This decline in the number of bank employees is a trend that has been observed in most countries since 2008.
The data also indicate that the degree of concentration in the banking sector (measured by the share of assets held by the five largest banks) continues to vary considerably between EU Member States. At the national level the share of total assets of the five largest credit institutions ranged from 29.65% to 98.01%, while the EU average at the end of 2021 was 67.71%.
The structural financial indicators are published by the ECB on an annual basis.

Biennial report assesses progress of seven non-euro area EU Member States
Positive assessment of Croatia in view of possible euro adoption on 1 January 2023
Progress has been limited overall owing to challenging economic conditions
Limited progress has been made by non-euro area EU countries on economic convergence with the euro area since 2020, the June 2022 Convergence Report of the European Central Bank (ECB) concludes. This is mainly due to challenging economic conditions.
The report, which is issued every two years, assesses progress towards euro adoption by seven EU countries that have not yet adopted the euro: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden.
The report includes a more in-depth assessment of Croatia, which has announced its intention to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023. Bulgaria and Croatia both joined the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) and the banking union on 10 July 2020.
The coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis led to a significant drop in economic activity in 2020, from which all countries under review rebounded strongly. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has weighed on growth, and inflation has increased in all the countries assessed. However, it is too early to draw any firm conclusions about how the convergence paths will be affected. The forward-looking convergence assessment is surrounded by high uncertainty, and the full impact can only be evaluated ex post.
As regards the price stability criterion, only Croatia and Sweden recorded inflation rates below or well below the reference value of 4.9%. This reference rate is based on the average inflation figures recorded in the three best-performing countries over the last 12 months – Finland, France and Greece (after exclusion of the outliers: Malta and Portugal). In the five other countries assessed – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania – inflation rates were well above the reference value over the last 12 months, as was also the case in the 2020 Convergence Report.
On the fiscal criteria, at the time of the publication of the report, only Romania is subject to an excessive deficit procedure (launched in April 2020). Although three further countries under review – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Hungary – exceeded the 3% of GDP deficit reference value in 2021, no new excessive deficit procedures were opened.
After a sharp increase in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, budget deficits remained elevated in all countries in 2021 except Sweden. Compared with 2020, budget balances improved in all the countries under review in 2021 except Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. According to the European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast, the deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline in most of the countries in 2022 and 2023. Nonetheless, it is expected to exceed the reference value in 2023 in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania.
The government debt-to-GDP ratio was between 20% and 40% in Bulgaria and Sweden in 2021 and reached between 40% and 60% in the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, while the debt ratios in Croatia and Hungary were above the 60% reference value.
In 2022 and 2023 government debt ratios are expected to decline in four of the countries as a result of both the improvement in economic activity and the phasing-out of fiscal measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while budget balances are expected to be burdened by new measures taken in response to high energy prices and the Russia-Ukraine war.
As regards the exchange rate criterion, the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna participated in ERM II for most of the two-year reference period from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022, at central rates of 1.95583 levs per euro and 7.53450 kuna per euro respectively. The exchange rate of the Croatian kuna displayed a low degree of volatility and traded close to its central rate. The Bulgarian lev did not deviate from its central rate. Except for the Romanian leu, the exchange rates of the currencies not participating in ERM II showed a relatively high degree of volatility.
When considering the convergence of long-term interest rates, the lowest 12-month average long-term interest rates were recorded in Bulgaria, Croatia and Sweden. At 2.5%, the Czech Republic was just below the reference value of 2.6%. Two of the countries under review – Hungary and Poland – recorded 12-month average long-term interest rates above the reference value, while in Romania the 12-month average long-term interest rate was well above the reference value.
The strength of the institutional environment is an important factor in the sustainability of convergence over time. Except in Sweden, the quality of institutions and governance in the countries under review is relatively weak. When it comes to legal convergence, Croatia is the only country examined where the legal framework is fully compatible with the requirements for adoption of the euro under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (Statute of the ESCB).
Croatia
The ECB’s assessment concludes that Croatia is within the reference values of the convergence criteria.
Price stability
In April 2022 the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation in Croatia was 4.7%, i.e. below the reference value of 4.9%. This rate is expected to increase gradually over the coming months, driven mainly by the higher commodity prices, broadening price pressures and further aggravation of supply bottlenecks as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Looking ahead, there are concerns about whether inflation convergence is sustainable over the longer term in Croatia. In order to prevent the build-up of excessive price pressures and macroeconomic imbalances, the convergence process must be supported by appropriate policies.
General government deficit and debt ratios
Croatia’s general government budget balance was just below the 3% of GDP deficit reference value in 2021, while its debt ratio was above the 60% of GDP reference value, but declined from the previous year. The deficit ratio amounted to 2.9% of GDP in 2021, which fulfills the deficit criterion. The debt ratio was 79.8% of GDP in 2021, a decline from the peak of 87.3% of GDP in 2020. This strong decline in the debt ratio ensured fulfillment of the debt criterion.
The European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast indicates that Croatia is on track to continue to be compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, the European Commission found in its 2022 European Semester Spring Package that Croatia faces medium debt sustainability risks over the medium term. To safeguard sound public finances and put the debt ratio onto a long-lasting downward path, it is essential that Croatia implements the envisaged fiscal reforms under its recovery and resilience plan.
Exchange rate
The Croatian kuna was included in ERM II on 10 July 2020 at a central rate of 7.53450 kuna per euro with a standard fluctuation band of ±15%. Over the two-year reference period from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022, the exchange rate displayed a low degree of volatility and the kuna traded close to its central rate.
Long-term interest rates
Over the reference period from May 2021 to April 2022, long-term interest rates in Croatia stood at 0.8% on average, which was below the 2.6% reference value for the interest rate convergence criterion. Long-term interest rates in Croatia have decreased since 2012, with 12-month average rates declining from slightly below 7% to below 1%.
Sustainable convergence
Croatia would benefit from stability-oriented economic policies and wide-ranging structural reforms. In 2022 the European Commission concluded that the macroeconomic imbalances that the country was experiencing continued to subside in 2021, returning to their favourable pre-pandemic trends. Structural reforms would help Croatia improve its institutional and business environment, boost competition and make its public administration and its judicial system more efficient. In October 2020 the ECB became responsible for directly supervising eight significant institutions and overseeing 15 less significant institutions in Croatia.
Legal criteria
Croatian law is compatible with the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB as required under Article 131 of the Treaty.

Notes
European Commission’s Convergence Report 2022
The Convergence Report of the ECB reviews the economic and legal convergence of non-euro area EU Member States with a derogation every second year or at the request of a specific country. It assesses the degree of sustainable economic convergence with the euro area, whether the national legislation is compatible with the EU legal framework, and whether the statutory requirements are fulfilled for the respective national central banks. Given its “opt-out” clause, Denmark is not covered by the assessment unless this is requested by the country.
The cut-off date for the statistics included in this Convergence Report was 25 May 2022. The reference period for the price stability and long-term interest rate criteria is from May 2021 to April 2022. For exchange rates, the reference period is from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022. Historical data on fiscal positions cover the period up to 2021. Forecasts are based on the European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast and the most recent convergence programmes of the countries concerned, as well as other information relevant to a forward-looking examination of the sustainability of convergence.
Since November 2014 any country joining the euro area has also joined the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the other components of the banking union. The banking system of the country in question is subject to a comprehensive assessment conducted by the ECB. On 10 July 2020 the ECB decided to establish close cooperation with ????????? ??????? ????? (Bulgarian National Bank) and Hrvatska narodna banka following the fulfilment of the necessary supervisory and legislative prerequisites. On 1 October 2020 the ECB became the supervisor in charge of common procedures for all supervised entities and assumed responsibility for the oversight of less significant institutions in the two countries."
,"Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the meeting of the Euro Accession Countries Working Group of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 1 June 2022
Thank you for inviting me to discuss our latest ECB Convergence Report.
[

]
As foreseen in the EU Treaties
[
2
]
, we publish our Convergence Report at least once every two years. The report examines the progress made by non-euro area Member States
[

]
towards satisfying the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency. Specifically, it assesses whether a high degree of sustainable economic convergence has been achieved.
[
4
]
Moreover, it examines whether the national legislation is compatible with the EU Treaties (including our Statute
[
5
]
), and whether the statutory requirements are fulfilled for the relevant national central bank to become an integral part of the Eurosystem.
Our assessment is independent from the Commission’s assessment, which has just been presented to you by Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis. I will now briefly discuss our conclusions on the state of economic and legal convergence. I will then focus on our assessment of Croatia.
The state of economic and legal convergence in non-euro area countries
Looking at the general picture first, let me highlight four points.
First, since our last Convergence Report in 2020, the seven Member States under review have made limited progress overall towards meeting the convergence criteria, with the notable exception of Croatia. This lack of progress is mainly due to challenging economic conditions. While the countries rebounded strongly from a longer than initially expected COVID-19 shock, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has darkened economic prospects.
Second, apart from Croatia, none of the other countries under review complies with all economic convergence criteria. In five of the seven Member States examined in the report, HICP inflation is well above the reference value. The long-term interest rate is above the reference value in two countries and well above it in one country. The situation has clearly deteriorated compared with 2020, when only one country was above the reference value. Furthermore, most countries have made no progress in reducing fiscal imbalances, which is not surprising given the COVID-19 pandemic and the fiscal measures adopted to mitigate its economic impact. As regards the exchange rate criterion, the Bulgarian lev and Croatian kuna were included in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), on 10 July 2020. Over the two-year reference period the Bulgarian lev did not exhibit any deviation from its central rate due to its currency board arrangement, while the Croatian kuna displayed a low degree of volatility and traded close to its central rate.
[
6
]
Third, all countries, with the exception of Croatia, need to adjust their legal framework to comply with the requirements under Union law. They must address issues relating to central bank independence and the prohibition on monetary financing.
Moreover, let me reiterate what I said here in 2020 when I presented our previous ECB Convergence Report.
[
7
]
In the interest of the euro area as a whole and of each euro area accession country, convergence has to be reached on a lasting basis, and not just at a given point in time. This requires ongoing attention, also through our economic governance mechanisms and sound financial sector supervision. In order to achieve a high level of sustainable convergence, our Convergence Report emphasises the need for lasting policy adjustments in many of the countries under review. Specifically, we emphasise that the Next Generation EU (NGEU) package represents a unique opportunity to accelerate the process of euro area convergence, with swift and effective implementation being crucial for its success.
The state of economic and legal convergence in Croatia
Let me now focus on Croatia, which is the only country that fulfils all economic and legal requirements for adopting the euro and has expressed the wish to do so on 1 January 2023.
With regard to price stability, the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation in Croatia was 4.7%, which is below the reference value of 4.9%. In terms of fiscal sustainability, Croatia’s general government budget balance was just below the 3% deficit reference value in 2021, while its debt ratio was above the 60% reference value but on a downward trajectory. Since the inclusion of the Croatian kuna in ERM II, its deviations from the agreed central rate have been significantly smaller than the standard fluctuation band of ERM II. Long-term interest rates stood at 0.8% on average and thus remained below the 2.6% reference value for the interest rate convergence criterion.
From a legal perspective, Croatian law is compatible with the Treaties and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. What is key is the amendment to the Law on Croatia’s central bank, which prohibits the Croatian Government from seeking to influence the members of its decision-making bodies.
With the entry into force of the close cooperation framework on 1 October 2020, the ECB gained responsibility for directly supervising eight significant institutions and for overseeing 15 less significant institutions in Croatia.
[

]
The convergence in banking supervision ensures the application of uniform supervisory standards and thus contributes to safeguarding financial stability.
Moreover, the agreement on Croatia’s participation in ERM II was based on several policy commitments which I discussed with you two years ago.

Although the anti-money laundering (AML) commitments have been fulfilled formally, there are still several shortcomings in this respect which must be addressed, as identified in the recent MONEYVAL report.
[
10
]
This is also key from a prudential perspective. We therefore urge the Croatian Government to deliver on its commitment to fully implement a new AML action plan by 2023, when the first year of MONEYVAL’s enhanced follow-up procedure ends.
Finally, our assessment stresses that, in view of the subdued growth potential, it is crucial to strengthen Croatia’s institutional capacity to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the structural reforms that can lift its growth path.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The convergence assessments by the Commission and the ECB are paving the way for another euro area enlargement. Two decades after the introduction of the single currency, euro area membership remains an attractive prospect.
The euro area is facing challenges on many fronts which are mainly of a global nature, like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and persistent supply chain disruptions. But the size of our Economic and Monetary Union gives us the economic firepower and policy autonomy to respond to these adverse external shocks. And the euro buttresses our supply chains, increasing their resilience. Supply chain integration in Europe is better than in any other continent, and continues to increase.

We appreciate that countries make every effort to prepare themselves for adopting the euro. And they do so under challenging economic conditions. I am convinced that the recent EU initiatives such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the REPowerEU Plan will help our economies stay on the path towards reforms and investment.
Croatia’s progress demonstrates its commitment to adopting the euro. Most importantly, it is another step towards economic and monetary integration in Europe. It further underpins our collective economic strength and our sovereignty."
,"1 Introduction
Since 1 January 1999 the euro has been introduced in 19 EU Member States; this report examines seven of the eight EU countries that have not yet adopted the single currency. One of the eight countries, Denmark, in 1992 notified the Council of the European Union (EU Council) of its intention not to participate in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
[

]
As a consequence, Convergence Reports only have to be provided for Denmark if the country so requests. Given the absence of such a request, this report examines the following countries: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden. All seven countries are committed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter the “Treaty”) to adopt the euro, which implies that they must strive to fulfil all the convergence criteria.
[

]
In producing this report, the ECB fulfils its requirement under Article 140 of the Treaty. Article 140 says that at least once every two years, or at the request of an EU Member State with a derogation, the ECB and the European Commission must report to the EU Council “on the progress made by the Member States with a derogation in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union”. The seven countries under review in this report have been examined as part of the regular two-year cycle. The European Commission has also prepared a report, and both reports are being submitted to the EU Council in parallel.
In this report, the ECB uses the framework applied in its previous Convergence Reports. It examines, for the seven countries concerned, whether a high degree of sustainable economic convergence has been achieved, whether the national legislation is compatible with the Treaties and the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the “Statute of the ESCB”), and whether the statutory requirements are fulfilled for the relevant national central bank (NCB) to become an integral part of the Eurosystem.
This report includes a more in-depth assessment of Croatia than of the other countries under review. This is because the Croatian authorities have on various occasions announced their intention to adopt the euro as of 1 January 2023.
The examination of the economic convergence process is highly dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying statistics. The compilation and reporting of statistics, particularly government finance statistics, must not be subject to political considerations or interference. EU Member States have been invited to consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a matter of high priority, to ensure that a proper system of checks and balances is in place when these statistics are compiled, and to apply minimum standards in the domain of statistics. These standards are of the utmost importance in reinforcing the independence, integrity and accountability of the national statistical institutes and in supporting confidence in the quality of government finance statistics (see Chapter 6).
From 4 November 2014
[

]
it became mandatory for any EU Member State whose derogation is abrogated to join the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) at the latest on the date on which it adopts the euro. At that point, all SSM-related rights and obligations start to apply to that country. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the necessary preparations are made. In particular, the banking system of any Member State joining the euro area, and therefore the SSM, is subject to a comprehensive assessment.

On 10 July 2020 the ECB announced that it had adopted the decisions to establish close cooperation with ????????? ??????? ????? (Bulgarian National Bank) and Hrvatska narodna banka, following the fulfilment of the necessary supervisory and legislative prerequisites.
[

]
With the entry into force of the close cooperation frameworks on 1 October that year, the ECB assumed responsibility for (i) the direct supervision of the significant institutions in the two countries, (ii) the common procedures for all supervised entities, and (iii) the oversight of less significant institutions, which continue to be supervised by their national supervisors. ECB Banking Supervision, ????????? ??????? ????? (Bulgarian National Bank) and Hrvatska narodna banka have collaborated very closely to ensure the smooth integration of the national competent authorities into the SSM.

This report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the framework used for the examination of economic and legal convergence. Chapter 3 provides a horizontal overview of the key aspects of economic convergence. Chapter 4 contains the country summaries, which provide the main results of the examination of economic and legal convergence. Chapter 5 examines in more detail the state of economic convergence in each of the seven EU Member States under review. Chapter 6 provides an overview of the convergence indicators and the statistical methodology used to compile them. Finally, Chapter 7 examines the compatibility of the national legislation of the Member States under review, including the statutes of their NCBs, with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty.
2 Framework for analysis
2.1 Economic convergence
To examine the state of economic convergence in EU Member States seeking to adopt the euro, the ECB makes use of a common framework for analysis. This common framework, which has been applied in a consistent manner throughout all European Monetary Institute (EMI) and ECB Convergence Reports, is based, first, on the Treaty provisions and their application by the ECB with regard to developments in prices, fiscal balances and debt ratios, exchange rates and long-term interest rates, as well as in other factors relevant to economic integration and convergence. Second, it is based on a range of additional backward and forward-looking economic indicators considered to be useful for examining the sustainability of convergence in greater detail. Some elements of this framework have been enhanced over time. The examination of the Member State concerned based on all these factors also provides important information which helps to ensure that its integration into the euro area will proceed without major difficulties. Boxes 1 to 5 below briefly outline the legal provisions and provide methodological details on the application of these provisions by the ECB.
This report builds on principles set out in previous reports published by the ECB (and prior to that by the EMI) in order to ensure continuity and equal treatment. In particular, a number of guiding principles are used by the ECB in the application of the convergence criteria. First, the individual criteria are interpreted and applied in a strict manner. The rationale behind this principle is that the main purpose of the criteria is to ensure that only those Member States with economic conditions conducive to the maintenance of price stability and the coherence of the euro area can participate in it. Second, the convergence criteria constitute a coherent and integrated package, and they must all be satisfied. The Treaty lists the criteria on an equal footing and does not suggest a hierarchy. Third, the convergence criteria have to be met on the basis of actual data. Fourth, the application of the convergence criteria should be consistent, transparent and simple. Moreover, when considering compliance with the convergence criteria, sustainability is an essential factor, as convergence must be achieved on a lasting basis and not just at a given point in time. For this reason, the country examinations elaborate on the sustainability of convergence.
In this respect, economic developments in the countries concerned are reviewed from a backward-looking perspective, covering, in principle, the past ten years. This helps to better determine the extent to which current achievements are the result of genuine structural adjustments, which in turn should lead to a better assessment of the sustainability of economic convergence.
In addition, and to the extent appropriate, a forward-looking perspective is adopted. In this context, particular attention is paid to the fact that the sustainability of favourable economic developments hinges critically on appropriate and lasting policy responses to existing and future challenges. Strong governance, sound institutions and sustainable public finances are also essential for supporting sustainable output growth over the medium to long term. Overall, it is emphasised that ensuring the sustainability of economic convergence depends on the achievement of a strong starting position, the existence of sound institutions, resilience to shocks and the pursuit of appropriate policies after the adoption of the euro.
The common framework is applied individually to the seven EU Member States under review. These examinations, which focus on each Member State’s performance, should be considered separately, in line with the provisions of Article 140 of the Treaty.
The cut-off date for the statistics included in this Convergence Report was 25 May 2022. The statistical data used in the application of the convergence criteria are provided by the European Commission (see Chapter 6 as well as the tables and charts), in cooperation with the ECB in the case of exchange rates and long-term interest rates. In agreement with the European Commission, the reference period for both the price stability criterion and the long-term interest rate criterion is from May 2021 to April 2022. For exchange rates, the reference period is from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022. Historical data on fiscal positions cover the period up to 2021. Account is also taken of forecasts from various sources, together with the most recent convergence programme of the Member State concerned and other information relevant to a forward-looking examination of the sustainability of convergence. The European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast and the Alert Mechanism Report 2022
[

]
, which are also taken into account in this report, were released on 16 May 2022 and 24 November 2021 respectively. This report was adopted by the General Council of the ECB on 27 May 2022.
This Convergence Report considers the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the convergence assessment only to a limited extent. It is too early to draw any firm conclusions about how the convergence paths will be affected and whether this effect will materialise in a symmetric or asymmetric way across the relevant countries. In particular, the forward-looking convergence assessment is surrounded by high uncertainty, and the full impact can only be evaluated ex post.
With regard to price developments, the legal provisions and their application by the ECB are outlined in Box 1.
Box 1
Price developments
1. Treaty provisions
Article 140(1), first indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criterion:
“the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation which is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability”.
Article 1 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that:
“The criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall mean that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than 1½ percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. Inflation shall be measured by means of the consumer price index on a comparable basis taking into account differences in national definitions”.
2. Application of Treaty provisions
In the context of this report, the ECB applies the Treaty provisions as outlined below.
First, with regard to “an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination”, the inflation rate has been calculated using the change in the 12-month average of the HICP in the reference period from May 2021 to April 2022 compared with the previous 12-month average. Inflation has been measured on the basis of the HICP, which was developed for the purpose of assessing convergence in terms of price stability on a comparable basis (see Section 6.2).
Second, the notion of “at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability”, which is used for the definition of the reference value, has been applied by taking the unweighted arithmetic average of the rates of inflation of the following three Member States: France (3.2%), Finland (3.3%) and Greece (3.6%). As a result, adding 1½ percentage points to the average rate, the reference value is 4.9%. It should be stressed that under the Treaty a country’s inflation performance is examined in relative terms, i.e. against that of other Member States. The price stability criterion thus takes into account the fact that common shocks (stemming, for example, from global commodity prices) can temporarily drive inflation rates away from central banks’ targets.
The inflation rates of Malta and Portugal have been excluded from the calculation of the reference value. Price developments in these countries over the reference period resulted in a 12-month average inflation rate in April 2022 of 2.1% and 2.6% respectively. These two countries have been treated as “outliers” for the calculation of the reference value, as inflation rates in both countries were significantly lower than the comparable rates in other Member States over the reference period and, in both countries, this was due to exceptional factors. In Malta, subdued inflation developments largely reflected stable energy prices, owing to the Government’s financial support for the state-owned energy company and a reduction in the excise tax on fuel, as well as technical factors related to the computation of the index. In particular, the household consumption basket changed considerably in 2020, albeit temporarily, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought about a large change in the weights of certain subcomponents of the index in 2021. This pattern was particularly pronounced for services inflation. In Portugal, the difference in inflation dynamics vis-à-vis the euro area is mainly the result of more subdued growth in both services and energy prices. While the former reflects a higher impact of depressed demand for tourism-related services, the latter is due to a lower pass-through of the increase in international oil prices and other energy costs.

]
The average rate of HICP inflation over the 12-month reference period from May 2021 to April 2022 is reviewed in the light of the country’s economic performance over the last ten years in terms of price stability. This allows a more detailed examination of the sustainability of price developments in the country under review. In this connection, attention is paid to the orientation of monetary policy, in particular to whether the focus of the monetary authorities has been primarily on achieving and maintaining price stability, as well as to the contribution of other areas of economic policy to this objective. Moreover, the implications of the macroeconomic environment for the achievement of price stability are taken into account. Price developments are examined in the light of supply and demand conditions, focusing on factors such as unit labour costs and import prices. Finally, trends in other relevant price indices are considered. From a forward-looking perspective, a view is provided of prospective inflationary developments in the coming years, including forecasts by major international organisations and market participants. Moreover, institutional and structural aspects relevant for maintaining an environment conducive to price stability after adoption of the euro are discussed.
With regard to fiscal developments, the legal provisions and their application by the ECB, together with procedural issues, are outlined in Box 2.
Box 2
Fiscal developments
1. Treaty and other legal provisions
Article 140(1), second indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criterion:
“the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with Article 126(6)”.
Article 2 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that:
“The criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 126(6) of the said Treaty that an excessive deficit exists”.
Article 126 sets out the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). In accordance with Article 126(2) and (3), the European Commission prepares a report if a Member State does not fulfil the requirements for fiscal discipline, in particular if:
the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to GDP exceeds a reference value (defined in the Protocol on the EDP as 3% of GDP), unless either:
the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value; or, alternatively,
the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference value;
the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeds a reference value (defined in the Protocol on the EDP as 60% of GDP), unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.
In addition, the report prepared by the Commission must take into account whether the government deficit exceeds government investment expenditure and all other relevant factors, including the medium-term economic and budgetary position of the Member State. The Commission may also prepare a report if, notwithstanding the fulfilment of the criteria, it is of the opinion that there is a risk of an excessive deficit in a Member State. The Economic and Financial Committee formulates an opinion on the Commission’s report. Finally, in accordance with Article 126(6), the EU Council, on the basis of a recommendation from the Commission and having considered any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make, decides, acting by qualified majority and excluding the Member State concerned, and following an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists in a Member State.
The Treaty provisions under Article 126 are further clarified by Regulation (EC) No 1467/97
[
9
]
as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1177/2011
[
10
]
, which, among other things:
confirms the equal footing of the debt criterion with the deficit criterion by making the former operational, while allowing for a three-year period of transition for Member States exiting EDPs opened before 2011. Article 2(1a) of the Regulation provides that when it exceeds the reference value, the ratio of the government debt to GDP shall be considered sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace if the differential with respect to the reference value has decreased over the previous three years at an average rate of one twentieth per year as a benchmark, based on changes over the last three years for which the data are available. The requirement under the debt criterion shall also be considered to be fulfilled if the required reduction in the differential looks set to occur over a defined three-year period, based on the Commission’s budgetary forecast. In implementing the debt reduction benchmark, the influence of the economic cycle on the pace of debt reduction shall be taken into account;
details the relevant factors that the Commission shall take into account when preparing a report under Article 126(3) of the Treaty. Most importantly, it specifies a series of factors considered relevant in assessing developments in medium-term economic, budgetary and government debt positions (see Article 2(3) of the Regulation and, below, details on the ensuing ECB analysis).
Moreover, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (TSCG), which builds on the provisions of the enhanced Stability and Growth Pact, entered into force on 1 January 2013.
[
11
]
Title III (Fiscal Compact) provides, among other things, for a binding fiscal rule aimed at ensuring that the general government budget is balanced or in surplus. This rule is deemed to be respected if the annual structural balance meets the country-specific medium-term objective and does not exceed a deficit – in structural terms – of 0.5% of GDP. If the government debt ratio is significantly below 60% of GDP and risks to long-term fiscal sustainability are low, the medium-term objective can be set at a structural deficit of at most 1% of GDP. The TSCG also includes the debt reduction benchmark rule referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1177/2011, which amended Regulation (EC) No 1467/97. The signatory Member States are required to introduce in their constitution – or equivalent law of higher level than the annual budget law – the stipulated fiscal rules accompanied by an automatic correction mechanism in case of deviation from the fiscal objective.
2. Application of Treaty provisions
For the purpose of examining convergence, the ECB expresses its view on fiscal developments. With regard to sustainability, the ECB examines key indicators of fiscal developments from 2012 to 2021, the outlook and the challenges for general government finances, focusing on the links between deficit and debt developments. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general government finances, the ECB refers to the Stability and Growth Pact’s general escape clause, which was activated on 20 March 2020. In particular, for the preventive arm, Articles 5(1) and 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1466/97
[
12
]
state that “in periods of severe economic downturn for the euro area or the Union as a whole, Member States may be allowed temporarily to depart from the adjustment path towards the medium-term budgetary objective…, provided that this does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term”. For the corrective arm, Article 3(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 stipulates that “in the case of a severe economic downturn in the euro area or in the Union as a whole, the Council may also decide, on a recommendation from the Commission, to adopt a revised recommendation under Article 126(7) TFEU provided that this does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term”, while Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 stipulates that “in the case of a severe economic downturn in the euro area or in the Union as a whole, the Council may also decide, on a recommendation from the Commission, to adopt a revised notice under Article 126(9) TFEU, on condition that this does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term”. The ECB also provides an analysis with regard to the effectiveness of national budgetary frameworks, as referred to in Article 2(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 and in Directive 2011/85/EU
[
13
]
. With regard to Article 126, the ECB, in contrast to the Commission, has no formal role in the EDP. Therefore, the ECB report only states whether the country is subject to an EDP.
With regard to the Treaty provision that a debt ratio of above 60% of GDP should be “sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace”, the ECB examines past and future trends in the debt ratio. For Member States in which the debt ratio exceeds the reference value, the ECB provides the European Commission’s latest assessment of compliance with the debt reduction benchmark laid down in Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97.
The examination of fiscal developments is based on data compiled on a national accounts basis, in compliance with the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) (see Chapter 6). Most of the figures presented in this report were provided by the Commission in April 2022 and include government financial positions from 2012 to 2021 as well as Commission forecasts for 2022-23.
With regard to the sustainability of public finances, the outcome in the reference year, 2021, is reviewed in the light of the performance of the country under review over the past ten years. First, the development of the deficit ratio is investigated. It is useful to bear in mind that the change in a country’s annual deficit ratio is typically influenced by a variety of underlying forces. These influences can be divided into “cyclical effects” on the one hand, which reflect the reaction of deficits to changes in the economic cycle, and “non-cyclical effects” on the other, which are often taken to reflect structural or permanent adjustments to fiscal policies. However, such non-cyclical effects, as quantified in this report, cannot necessarily be seen as entirely reflecting a structural change to fiscal positions, because they include temporary effects on the budgetary balance stemming from the impact of both policy measures and special factors. Indeed, assessing how structural budgetary positions have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly difficult in view of uncertainty over the level and growth rate of potential output.
As a further step, the development of the government debt ratio in this period is considered, as well as the factors underlying it. These factors are the difference between nominal GDP growth and interest rates, the primary balance and the deficit-debt adjustment. Such a perspective can offer further information on the extent to which the macroeconomic environment, in particular the combination of growth and interest rates, has affected the dynamics of debt. It can also provide more information on the contribution of the structural balance and the cyclical developments, as reflected in the primary balance, and on the role played by special factors, as included in the deficit-debt adjustment. In addition, the structure of government debt is considered, by focusing in particular on the shares of debt with a short-term maturity and foreign currency debt, as well as their development. By comparing these shares with the current level of the debt ratio, the sensitivity of fiscal balances to changes in exchange rates and interest rates can be highlighted.
Turning to a forward-looking perspective, national budget plans and recent forecasts by the European Commission for 2022-23 are considered, and account is taken of the medium-term fiscal strategy, as reflected in the convergence programme. This includes an assessment of the projected attainment of the country’s medium-term budgetary objective, as foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as of the outlook for the debt ratio on the basis of current fiscal policies. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the general escape clause has been activated and allows deviations from the medium-term budgetary objective as described in Box 2. In addition, long-term challenges to the sustainability of budgetary positions and broad areas for consolidation are emphasised, particularly those related to the issue of unfunded government pension systems in connection with demographic change and to contingent liabilities incurred by the government. Furthermore, in line with past practice, the analysis described above also covers most of the relevant factors identified in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, as described in Box 2.
With regard to exchange rate developments, the legal provisions and their application by the ECB are outlined in Box 3.
Box 3
Exchange rate developments
1. Treaty provisions
Article 140(1), third indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criterion:
“the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the euro”.
Article 3 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that:
“The criterion on participation in the Exchange Rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism on the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State shall not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same period”.
2. Application of Treaty provisions
With regard to exchange rate stability, the ECB examines whether the country has participated in ERM II (which superseded the ERM as of January 1999) for a period of at least two years prior to the convergence examination without severe tensions, in particular without devaluing against the euro. In cases of shorter periods of participation, exchange rate developments are described over a two-year reference period.
The examination of exchange rate stability against the euro focuses on the exchange rate being close to the ERM II central rate, while also taking into account factors that may have led to an appreciation, which is in line with the approach taken in the past. In this respect, the width of the fluctuation band within ERM II does not prejudice the examination of the exchange rate stability criterion.
Moreover, the issue of the absence of “severe tensions” is generally addressed by: (i) examining the degree of deviation of exchange rates from the ERM II central rates against the euro; (ii) using indicators such as exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis the euro and its trend, as well as short-term interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the euro area and their development; (iii) considering the role played by foreign exchange interventions; and (iv) considering the role of international financial assistance programmes in stabilising the currency.
The reference period in this report is from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022. All bilateral exchange rates are official ECB reference rates (see Chapter 6).
In addition to ERM II participation and nominal exchange rate developments against the euro over the period under review, evidence relevant to the sustainability of the current exchange rate is briefly reviewed. This is derived from the development of the real effective exchange rates and the current, capital and financial accounts of the balance of payments. The evolution of gross external debt and the net international investment position over longer periods is also examined. The section on exchange rate developments further considers measures of the degree of a country’s integration with the euro area. This is assessed in terms of both external trade integration (exports and imports) and financial integration. Finally, the section on exchange rate developments reports, if applicable, whether the country under examination has during the two-year reference period benefited from central bank liquidity assistance or balance of payments support, either bilaterally or multilaterally with the involvement of the IMF and/or the EU. Both actual and precautionary assistance are considered, including access to precautionary financing in the form of, for instance, the IMF’s Flexible Credit Line.
With regard to long-term interest rate developments, the legal provisions and their application by the ECB are outlined in Box 4.
Box 4
Long-term interest rate developments
1. Treaty provisions
Article 140(1), fourth indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criterion:
“the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State with a derogation and of its participation in the exchange-rate mechanism being reflected in the long-term interest-rate levels”.
Article 4 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that:
“The criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. Interest rates shall be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable securities, taking into account differences in national definitions”.
2. Application of Treaty provisions
In the context of this report, the ECB applies the Treaty provisions as outlined below.
First, with regard to “an average nominal long-term interest rate” observed over “a period of one year before the examination”, the long-term interest rate has been calculated as an arithmetic average over the latest 12 months for which HICP data were available. The reference period considered in this report is from May 2021 to April 2022, in line with the reference period for the price stability criterion.
Second, the notion of “at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability”, which is used for the definition of the reference value, has been applied by using the unweighted arithmetic average of the long-term interest rates of the same three Member States included in the calculation of the reference value for the criterion on price stability (see Box 1). Over the reference period considered in this report, the long-term interest rates of the three countries with the lowest inflation rate included in the calculation of the reference value for the price stability criterion were 0.3% (France), 0.2% (Finland) and 1.4% (Greece). As a result, the average rate is 0.6% and, adding 2 percentage points, the reference value is 2.6%. Interest rates have been measured on the basis of available harmonised long-term interest rates, which were developed for the purpose of examining convergence (see Chapter 6).
As mentioned above, the Treaty makes explicit reference to the “durability of convergence” being reflected in the level of long-term interest rates. Therefore, developments over the reference period from May 2021 to April 2022 are reviewed against the background of the path of long-term interest rates over the past ten years (or otherwise the period for which data are available) and the main factors underlying differentials vis-à-vis the average long-term interest rate prevailing in the euro area. During the reference period, the average euro area long-term interest rate may have partly reflected high country-specific risk premia in several euro area countries. Therefore, the euro area AAA long-term government bond yield (i.e. the long-term yield of the euro area AAA yield curve, which includes the euro area countries with an AAA rating) is also used for comparison purposes. As background to this analysis, this report also provides information about the size and development of the financial market. This is based on three different indicators (the outstanding amount of debt securities issued by non-financial corporations, stock market capitalisation and MFI credit to the domestic non-financial private sector), which, together, provide a measure of the size of financial markets.
Finally, Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires this report to take account of several other relevant factors (see Box 5). In this respect, an enhanced economic governance framework in accordance with Article 121(6) of the Treaty entered into force on 13 December 2011 with the aim of ensuring a closer coordination of economic policies and the sustained convergence of EU Member States’ economic performances. Box 5 below briefly outlines these legislative provisions and the way in which the above-mentioned additional factors are addressed in the assessment of convergence conducted by the ECB.

Other relevant factors
1. Treaty and other legal provisions
Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires that: “The reports of the Commission and the European Central Bank shall also take account of the results of the integration of markets, the situation and development of the balances of payments on current account and an examination of the development of unit labour costs and other price indices”.
In this respect, the ECB takes into account the legislative package on EU economic governance which entered into force on 13 December 2011. Building on the Treaty provisions under Article 121(6), the European Parliament and the EU Council adopted detailed rules for the multilateral surveillance procedure referred to in Article 121(3) and (4) of the Treaty. These rules were adopted “in order to ensure closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of the economic performances of the Member States” (Article 121(3)) in view of the “need to draw lessons from the first decade of functioning of the economic and monetary union and, in particular, for improved economic governance in the Union built on stronger national ownership”
[
14
]
. The legislative package includes an enhanced surveillance framework (the macroeconomic imbalance procedure or MIP) aimed at preventing excessive macroeconomic and macro-financial imbalances by helping diverging EU Member States to establish corrective plans before divergence becomes entrenched. The MIP, with both preventive and corrective arms, applies to all EU Member States, except those which, being under an international financial assistance programme, are already subject to closer scrutiny coupled with conditionality. The MIP includes an alert mechanism for the early detection of imbalances, based on a transparent scoreboard of indicators with alert thresholds for all EU Member States, combined with economic judgement. This judgement should take into account, among other things, nominal and real convergence inside and outside the euro area.
[
15
]
When assessing macroeconomic imbalances, this procedure should take due account of their severity and their potential negative economic and financial spillover effects which aggravate the vulnerability of the EU economy and threaten the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.
[
16
]
2. Application of Treaty provisions
In line with past practice, the additional factors referred to in Article 140(1) of the Treaty are reviewed in Chapter 5 under the headings of the individual criteria described in Boxes 1 to 4. For completeness, in Chapter 3 the scoreboard indicators are presented for the countries covered in this report (including in relation to the alert thresholds), thereby ensuring the provision of all available information relevant to the detection of macroeconomic and macro-financial imbalances that may be hampering the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence as stipulated in Article 140(1) of the Treaty. Notably, EU Member States with a derogation that are subject to an excessive imbalance procedure can hardly be considered as having achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence as stipulated in Article 140(1) of the Treaty.
2.2 Compatibility of national legislation with the Treaties
2.2.1 Introduction
Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires the ECB (and the European Commission) to report, at least once every two years or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, to the Council on the progress made by the Member States with a derogation in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union. These reports must include an examination of the compatibility between the national legislation of each Member State with a derogation, including the statutes of its NCB, and Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty and the relevant Articles of the Statute. This Treaty obligation of Member States with a derogation is also referred to as ‘legal convergence’.
When assessing legal convergence, the ECB is not limited to making a formal assessment of the letter of national legislation, but may also consider whether the implementation of the relevant provisions complies with the spirit of the Treaties and the Statute. The ECB is particularly concerned about any signs of pressure being put on the decision-making bodies of any Member State’s NCB which would be inconsistent with the spirit of the Treaty as regards central bank independence. The ECB also sees the need for the smooth and continuous functioning of the NCBs’ decision-making bodies. In this respect, the relevant authorities of a Member State have, in particular, the duty to take the necessary measures to ensure the timely appointment of a successor if the position of a member of an NCB’s decision-making body becomes vacant.
[
17
]
The ECB will closely monitor any developments prior to making a positive final assessment concluding that a Member State’s national legislation is compatible with the Treaty and the Statute.
Member States with a derogation and legal convergence
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden, whose national legislation is examined in this report, each have the status of a Member State with a derogation, i.e. they have not yet adopted the euro. Sweden was given the status of a Member State with a derogation by a decision of the Council in May 1998.
[
18
]
As far as the other Member States are concerned, Articles 4
[
19
]
and 5
[
20
]
of the Acts concerning the conditions of accession provide that each of these Member States shall participate in the Economic and Monetary Union from the date of accession as a Member State with a derogation within the meaning of Article 139 of the Treaty.
This report does not cover Denmark, which is a Member State with a special status and which has not yet adopted the euro. Protocol (No 16) on certain provisions relating to Denmark, annexed to the Treaties, provides that, in view of the notice given to the Council by the Danish Government on 3 November 1993, Denmark has an exemption and that the procedure for the abrogation of the derogation will only be initiated at the request of Denmark. As Article 130 of the Treaty applies to Denmark, Danmarks Nationalbank has to fulfil the requirements of central bank independence. The EMI’s Convergence Report of 1998 concluded that this requirement had been fulfilled. There has been no assessment of Danish convergence since 1998 due to Denmark’s special status. Until such time as Denmark notifies the Council that it intends to adopt the euro, Danmarks Nationalbank does not need to be legally integrated into the Eurosystem and no Danish legislation needs to be adapted.
The aim of assessing legal convergence is to facilitate the Council’s decisions as to which Member States fulfil ‘their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union’ (Article 140(1) of the Treaty). In the legal domain, such conditions refer in particular to central bank independence and to the NCBs’ legal integration into the Eurosystem.
Structure of the legal assessment
The legal assessment broadly follows the framework of the previous reports of the ECB and the EMI on legal convergence.
[
21
]
The compatibility of national legislation is considered in the light of legislation enacted before 25 March 2022.
2.2.2 Scope of adaptation
Areas of adaptation
For the purpose of identifying those areas where national legislation needs to be adapted, the following issues are examined:
compatibility with provisions on the independence of NCBs in the Treaty (Article 130) and the Statute (Articles 7 and 14.2);
compatibility with provisions on confidentiality (Article 37 of the Statute);
compatibility with the prohibitions on monetary financing (Article 123 of the Treaty) and privileged access (Article 124 of the Treaty);
compatibility with the single spelling of the euro required by EU law; and
legal integration of the NCBs into the Eurosystem (in particular as regards Articles 12.1 and 14.3 of the Statute).
‘Compatibility’ versus ‘harmonisation’
Article 131 of the Treaty requires national legislation to be ‘compatible’ with the Treaties and the Statute; any incompatibility must therefore be remedied. Neither the primacy of the Treaties and the Statute over national legislation nor the nature of the incompatibility affects the need to comply with this obligation.
The requirement for national legislation to be ‘compatible’ does not mean that the Treaty requires ‘harmonisation’ of the NCBs’ statutes, either with each other or with the Statute. National particularities may continue to exist to the extent that they do not infringe the competence in monetary matters that is irrevocably conferred on the EU. Indeed, Article 14.4 of the Statute permits NCBs to perform functions other than those specified in the Statute, to the extent that they do not interfere with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.
[
22
]
Provisions authorising such additional functions in NCBs’ statutes are a clear example of circumstances in which differences may remain. Rather, the term ‘compatible’ indicates that national legislation and the NCBs’ statutes need to be adjusted to eliminate inconsistencies with the Treaties and the Statute and to ensure the necessary degree of integration of the NCBs into the ESCB. In particular, any provisions that infringe an NCB’s independence, as defined in the Treaty, and its role as an integral part of the ESCB, should be adjusted. It is therefore insufficient to rely solely on the primacy of EU law over national legislation to achieve this.
The obligation in Article 131 of the Treaty only covers incompatibility with the Treaties and the Statute. However, national legislation that is incompatible with secondary EU legislation relevant for the areas of adaptation examined in this Convergence Report should be brought into line with such secondary legislation. The primacy of EU law does not affect the obligation to adapt national legislation. This general requirement derives not only from Article 131 of the Treaty but also from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
[
23
]
The Treaties and the Statute do not prescribe the manner in which national legislation should be adapted. This may be achieved by referring to the Treaties and the Statute, by incorporating provisions thereof and referring to their provenance, by removing any incompatibility, or by a combination of these methods.
Furthermore, among other things as a tool for achieving and maintaining the compatibility of national legislation with the Treaties and the Statute, the ECB must be consulted by the EU institutions and by the Member States on draft legislative provisions in its fields of competence, pursuant to Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty and Article 4 of the Statute. Council Decision 98/415/EC of 29 June 1998 on the consultation of the European Central Bank by national authorities regarding draft legislative provisions
[
24
]
expressly requires Member States to take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with this obligation.
2.2.3 Independence of NCBs
As far as central bank independence is concerned, national legislation in the Member States that joined the EU in 2004, 2007 or 2013 had to be adapted to comply with the relevant provisions of the Treaty and the Statute, and be in force on 1 May 2004, 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2013 respectively.
[
25
]
Sweden had to bring the necessary adaptations into force by the date of establishment of the ESCB on 1 June 1998.
Central bank independence
In November 1995, the EMI established a list of features of central bank independence (later described in detail in its 1998 Convergence Report) which were the basis for assessing the national legislation of the Member States at that time, in particular the NCBs’ statutes. The concept of central bank independence includes various types of independence that must be assessed separately, namely: functional, institutional, personal and financial independence. Over the past few years there has been further refinement of the analysis of these aspects of central bank independence in the opinions adopted by the ECB. These aspects are the basis for assessing the level of convergence between the national legislation of the Member States with a derogation and the Treaties and the Statute.
Functional independence
Central bank independence is not an end in itself but is instrumental in achieving an objective that should be clearly defined and should prevail over any other objective. Functional independence requires each NCB’s primary objective to be stated in a clear and legally certain way and to be fully in line with the primary objective of price stability established by the Treaty. The pursuit of this objective is served by providing the NCBs with the necessary means and instruments for achieving this objective independently of any other authority. The Treaty’s requirement of central bank independence reflects the generally held view that the primary objective of price stability is best served by a fully independent institution with a precise definition of its mandate. Central bank independence is fully compatible with holding NCBs accountable for their decisions, which is an important aspect of enhancing confidence in their independent status. This entails transparency and dialogue with third parties.
As regards timing, the Treaty is not clear about when the NCBs of Member States with a derogation must comply with the primary objective of price stability set out in Articles 127(1) and 282(2) of the Treaty and Article 2 of the Statute. For those Member States that joined the EU after the date of the introduction of the euro in the EU, it is not clear whether this obligation should run from the date of accession or from the date of their adoption of the euro. While Article 127(1) of the Treaty does not apply to Member States with a derogation (see Article 139(2)(c) of the Treaty), Article 2 of the Statute does apply to such Member States (see Article 42.1 of the Statute). The ECB takes the view that the obligation of the NCBs to have price stability as their primary objective runs from 1 June 1998 in the case of Sweden, and from 1 May 2004, 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2013 for the Member States that joined the EU on those dates. This is based on the fact that one of the guiding principles of the EU, namely price stability (Article 119 of the Treaty), also applies to Member States with a derogation. It is also based on the Treaty objective that all Member States should strive for macroeconomic convergence, including price stability, which is the intention behind the regular reports of the ECB and the European Commission. This conclusion is also based on the underlying rationale of central bank independence, which is only justified if the overall objective of price stability has primacy.
The country assessments in this report are based on these conclusions as to the timing of the obligation of the NCBs of Member States with a derogation to have price stability as their primary objective.
Institutional independence
The principle of institutional independence is expressly referred to in Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the Statute. These two articles prohibit the NCBs and members of their decision-making bodies from seeking or taking instructions from EU institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. In addition, they prohibit EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, and the governments of the Member States from seeking to influence those members of the NCBs’ decision-making bodies whose decisions may affect the fulfilment of the NCBs’ ESCB-related tasks. For national legislation to mirror Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the Statute, it should reflect both prohibitions and not narrow the scope of their application.
[
26
]
The recognition that central banks have such independence does not have the consequence of exempting them from every rule of law or of shielding them from any kind of legislation.
[
27
]
Whether an NCB is organised as a state-owned body, a special public law body or simply a public limited company, there is a risk that influence may be exerted by the owner on its decision-making in relation to ESCB-related tasks by virtue of such ownership.
[
28
]
Such influence, whether exercised through shareholders’ rights or otherwise, may affect an NCB’s independence and should therefore be limited by law.
The legal framework for central banking needs to provide a stable and long-term basis for a central bank’s functioning. A legal framework that permits frequent changes to the institutional set-up of an NCB, thus affecting its organisational or governance stability, could adversely affect that NCB’s institutional independence.
[
29
]
Institutional independence should also be respected in cases of emergency. Only where the conditions under Article 347 of the Treaty are met, may national authorities be justified in exercising, on a temporary and exceptional basis, powers that fall within the exclusive competence of the ESCB. The critical time for this assessment is when the measure is adopted. Due to the exceptional nature of Article 347 of the Treaty, Member States should refrain from adopting preventive legislation in the absence of the conditions prescribed by Article 347 of the Treaty.
[
30
]
Prohibition on giving instructions
Rights of third parties to give instructions to NCBs, their decision-making bodies or their members are incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute as far as ESCB-related tasks are concerned.
Any involvement of an NCB in the application of measures to strengthen financial stability must be compatible with the Treaty, i.e. NCBs’ functions must be performed in a manner that is fully compatible with their functional, institutional, and financial independence so as to safeguard the proper performance of their tasks under the Treaty and the Statute.
[
31
]
To the extent that national legislation provides for a role of an NCB that goes beyond advisory functions and requires it to assume additional tasks, it must be ensured that these tasks will not affect the NCB’s ability to carry out its ESCB-related tasks from an operational and financial point of view.
[
32
]
Additionally, the inclusion of NCB representatives in collegiate decision-making supervisory bodies or other authorities would need to give due consideration to safeguards for the personal independence of the members of the NCB’s decision-making bodies.
[
33
]
Prohibition on approving, suspending, annulling or deferring decisions
Rights of third parties to approve, suspend, annul or defer an NCB’s decisions are incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute as far as ESCB-related tasks are concerned.
[
34
]
Prohibition on censoring decisions on legal grounds
A right for bodies other than independent courts to censor, on legal grounds, decisions relating to the performance of ESCB-related tasks is incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute, since the performance of these tasks may not be reassessed at the political level. A right of an NCB Governor to suspend the implementation of a decision adopted by the ESCB or by an NCB decision-making body on legal grounds and subsequently to submit it to a political body for a final decision would be equivalent to seeking instructions from third parties.
Prohibition on participation in decision-making bodies of an NCB with a right to vote
Participation by representatives of third parties in an NCB’s decision-making body with a right to vote on matters concerning the performance by the NCB of ESCB-related tasks is incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute, even if such vote is not decisive. Such participation even without the right to vote is incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute, if such participation interferes with the performance of ESCB-related tasks by that decision-making bodies or endangers compliance with the ESCB’s confidentiality regime.
[
35
]
Prohibition on ex ante consultation relating to an NCB’s decision
An express statutory obligation for an NCB to consult third parties ex ante relating to an NCB’s decision provides third parties with a formal mechanism to influence the final decision and is therefore incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute.
However, dialogue between an NCB and third parties, even when based on statutory obligations to provide information and exchange views, is compatible with central bank independence provided that:
this does not result in interference with the independence of the members of the NCB’s decision-making bodies;
the special status of Governors in their capacity as members of the ECB’s decision-making bodies is fully respected; and
confidentiality requirements resulting from the Statute are observed.[36]
Discharge provided for the duties of members of the NCB’s decision-making bodies
Statutory provisions regarding the discharge provided by third parties (e.g. governments) regarding the duties of members of the NCB’s decision-making bodies (e.g. in relation to accounts) should contain adequate safeguards, so that such a power does not impinge on the capacity of the individual NCB member independently to adopt decisions in respect of ESCB-related tasks (or implement decisions adopted at ESCB level). Inclusion of an express provision to this effect in NCB statutes is recommended.
Personal independence
The Statute’s provision on security of tenure for members of NCBs’ decision-making bodies further safeguards central bank independence. NCB Governors are members of the General Council of the ECB and become members of the Governing Council upon adoption of the euro by their Member States. NCB Governors cannot be regarded as representatives of a Member State when they perform their duties as members of the Governing Council or the General Council of the ECB.
[
37
]
Article 14.2 of the Statute provides that NCB statutes must, in particular, provide for a minimum term of office of five years for Governors. It also protects against Governors being arbitrarily relieved from their office by providing that they may only be relieved from office if they no longer fulfil the conditions required for performing their duties or if they [have been found guilty of serious misconduct. In such cases, Article 14.2 of the Statute provides for the possibility of recourse to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has the power to annul the national decision taken to relieve a Governor from office.
[
38
]
The suspension of a Governor may effectively amount to relieving a Governor from office for the purposes of Article 14.2 of the Statute.
[
39
]
NCB statutes must comply with this provision as set out below.
Article 130 of the Treaty prohibits national governments and any bodies from influencing the members of NCBs’ decision-making bodies in the performance of their tasks. In particular, Member States may not seek to influence the members of the NCB’s decision-making bodies by amending national legislation affecting their remuneration, which, as a matter of principle, should apply only for future appointments.
[
40
]
Minimum term of office for Governors
In accordance with Article 14.2 of the Statute, NCB statutes must provide for a minimum term of office of five years for a Governor. This does not preclude longer terms of office, while an indefinite term of office does not require adaptation of the statutes provided the grounds for the relieving a Governor from office are in line with those of Article 14.2 of the Statute. Shorter periods cannot be justified even if only applied during a transitional period.
[
41
]
National legislation which provides for a compulsory retirement age should ensure that the retirement age does not interrupt the minimum term of office provided by Article 14.2 of the Statute, which prevails over any compulsory retirement age, if applicable to a Governor.
[
42
]
When an NCB’s statutes are amended, the amending law should safeguard the security of tenure of the Governor and of other members of decision-making bodies who are involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks.
[
43
]
Grounds for relieving Governors from office
NCB statutes must ensure that Governors may not be dismissed for reasons other than those mentioned in Article 14.2 of the Statute. The purpose of the requirement under that Article is to prevent the authorities involved in the appointment of Governors, particularly the relevant government or parliament, from arbitrarily dismissing a Governor. NCB statutes should either refer to Article 14.2 of the Statute, incorporate its provisions and refer to their provenance, delete any incompatibility with the grounds for relieving from office laid down in Article 14.2, or omit any mention of grounds for relieving from office (since Article 14.2 is directly applicable).
[
44
]
Once elected or appointed, Governors may not be relieved from office under conditions other than those mentioned in Article 14.2 of the Statute even if they have not yet taken up their duties. As the conditions under which a Governor may be relieved from office are autonomous concepts of Union law, their application and interpretation do not depend on national contexts.
[
45
]
Ultimately, it is for the Court of Justice of the European Union, in accordance with the powers conferred on it by the second subparagraph of Article 14.2 of the Statute, to verify that a decision taken to relieve a Governor of a national central bank from office is justified by sufficient indications that they have engaged in serious misconduct capable of justifying such a measure.
[
46
]
Security of tenure and grounds for relieving from office of members of NCBs’ decision-making bodies, other than Governors, who are involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks
Applying the same rules for the security of tenure and grounds for relieving of Governors from office to other members of the decision-making bodies of NCBs involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks will also safeguard the personal independence of those persons.
[
47
]
The provisions of Article 14.2 of the Statute are not restricted to the security of tenure of office to Governors, and Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the Statute refer to “members of the decision-making bodies” of NCBs, rather than to Governors specifically. This applies in particular where a Governor is “first among equals” with colleagues with equivalent voting rights or where such other members are involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks.
Right of judicial review
Members of the NCBs’ decision-making bodies must have the right to submit any decision to relieve them from their office to an independent court of law, in order to limit the potential for political discretion in evaluating the grounds for such a decision.
Article 14.2 of the Statute stipulates that NCB Governors who have been dismissed from office may refer such a decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union. National legislation should either refer to the Statute or remain silent on the right to refer such a decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union (as Article 14.2 of the Statute is directly applicable). The Court of Justice of the European Union has the power to annul the national measure of dismissal if it is found to be contrary to Union law.
[
48
]
National legislation should also provide for a right of review by the national courts of a decision to dismiss any other member of the decision-making bodies of the NCB involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks. This right can either be a matter of general law or can it take the form of a specific provision. Even though this right may be available under the general law, for reasons of legal certainty it could be advisable to provide specifically for such a right of review.
Safeguards against conflicts of interest
Personal independence also entails ensuring that no conflict of interest arises between the duties of members of NCB decision-making bodies involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks in relation to their respective NCBs (and of Governors in relation to the ECB) and any other functions which such members of decision-making bodies may have and which may jeopardise their personal independence.
[
49
]
As a matter of principle, membership of a decision-making body involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks is incompatible with the exercise of other functions that might create a conflict of interest. In particular, members of such decision-making bodies may not hold an office or have an interest that may influence their activities, whether through office in the executive or legislative branch"

Euro area enterprises continued to signal a recovery in business activity, but firms’ profitability was reduced by surging input costs
The availability of external funds continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace, as euro area firms deemed the macroeconomic environment to have adversely affected the availability of funds.
While the availability of external funds was broadly in line with firms’ demand for financing, enterprises reported a tightening of financing conditions and expect a deterioration in the availability of funds
The results of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area for the period from October 2021 to March 2022 indicate that the recovery in firms’ economic activity continued, with increases in turnover reported more frequently among large enterprises than among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chart 1). However, firms’ profitability was reduced by surging production costs, with 89% of firms reporting, in net terms,
[

]
an increase in raw materials and energy costs and 66% in labour costs, both standing at a historical peak in the survey. The impact of supply disruptions and higher energy costs, which are likely to be related in part to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, is expected to continue to affect prices (Chart 2). Moreover, the perceived importance of expected inflation as a factor in selling prices has increased compared with 2020, with 58% of firms now reporting expected inflation as a “very important” factor (up from 30% in 2020).
In this survey round, while euro area firms felt that changes in the general economic outlook had had a strong negative impact on their access to finance (-29%, down from 8%), with a similar negative impact among SMEs and large firms, the availability of external funds still continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace. Overall, smaller improvements in firms’ access to external funds broadly compensated for the moderate increases in their financing needs, so that the external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the supply of external financing – reached 1% (up from -4% in the previous round).
A significant number of euro area firms reported a tightening of financing conditions, with 34% signalling increases in bank interest rates, up from 5% in the previous round (Chart 3). A comparable percentage has not been observed in the SAFE since 2012 and is consistent with the recent net widening on margins applied to bank loans also reported by banks in the April 2022 bank lending survey. Looking ahead firms anticipated a deterioration in access to bank loans and credit lines for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, probably reflecting the prevailing uncertainty and a changing attitude on the part of banks.
This report presents the main results of the 26th round of the SAFE in the euro area, which was conducted between 7 March 2022 and 15 April 2022, and covered the period from October 2021 to March 2022. The sample comprised 10,950 firms, of which 9,999 (91.3%) are SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

In this survey round, enterprises of all sizes, in particular large firms, reported that the lack of skilled labour and the rise in input costs were the dominant concerns for their business activity, while access to finance was among the least reported concerns (see Chart 4 in section 2). The lack of skilled labour continued to be the main concern for euro area firms (30%), followed by the increase in costs of production and labour (18%). At the same time, concerns about access to finance remained unchanged at a low level in the euro area as a whole (6%), while difficulty in finding customers declined (16%). Meanwhile, concerns about competition and regulatory burden (both 8%) were relatively limited for enterprises in the euro area.
Labour shortages and input costs were reported as pressing problems that had intensified over time (see Chart A in this section). On a scale of 1 to 10, the responses regarding the importance of these two factors as problems show that 67% and 63% of euro area firms respectively considered them to be extremely pressing.

This is the third round in which there has been an improvement since the historical low reached after the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Across firm sizes, it appears that large companies are still experiencing a faster rebound than small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Expectations of future turnover seem to have been dented somewhat at the very start of this survey round, immediately after the start of the war in Ukraine, but remained positive and relatively stable thereafter during the fieldwork period up to mid-April. A net 34% of euro area firms (down from 44% in the previous survey round) continue to expect an increase in turnover over the next six months (see Chart 18 in section 5). A positive but somewhat less optimistic outlook for future turnover was reported among both large companies (47%, down from 57%) and SMEs (27%, down from 36%).
Despite the ongoing expansion in turnover, euro area firms’ profitability weakened slightly, but with significant heterogeneity across firm sizes. More SMEs reported a deterioration in profits in net terms (-15% compared with -6% in the previous round), while large firms continued to signal a rise in profits, albeit somewhat less frequently than in the previous survey round (a net 15% compared with 20%).
The weaker profitability reflected a significant rise in materials and energy costs as well as labour costs. 89% of firms (up from 73% in net terms in the previous round) reported higher costs for materials and energy, most likely reflecting the surge in commodity and input prices during the reporting period, which was in part related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile 66% (up from 45%) signalled an increase in labour costs. For both types of costs, these net percentages represent new historical highs in the survey, which underscores the strength of the input cost pressures firms are currently experiencing and explains the toll on profits despite higher turnover. Moreover, the significant rise in production costs is widespread both across firm sizes and across countries.
In net terms, euro area firms reported moderate increases in the demand for bank loans and credit lines at the euro area level, with credit demand broadly in line with pre-pandemic levels in most euro area countries (see Table 1, columns 2 and 4 in this section). A net 5% of companies reported higher demand for bank loans (down from 2% in the previous survey round) and 7% for credit lines (up from 4%). The results are in line with the overall growth in bank loans recorded since last October in the euro area, even though they show some heterogeneity across size classes, with SMEs more often reporting increases in their need for credit lines than large firms. External and internal financing continued to be used primarily for fixed investment, inventories and working capital.
Overall, euro area firms still indicated an improvement in the availability of bank loans, albeit to a lesser extent than in the previous survey (5% compared with 10%) (see Table 1, column 6 in this section). Although the percentage of firms reporting improvements in availability was smaller than in the previous round across size classes, large companies continued to indicate a much higher improvement in the availability of banking products than SMEs.
Improvements in access to external funds broadly compensated for firms’ higher financing needs (see Table 1, column 10). In this survey round, 1% of firms reported a positive financing gap (up from -4%). Across size classes, large companies continued to report a negative financing gap (-2% compared with -7%), while SMEs are now indicating a small gap in their ability to finance demand (2% compared with -2%).

(net percentages of respondents)
Notes: For the “financing gap”, see the notes to Chart 9; for “financing obstacles”, see the notes to Chart 12. “2021 H1” refers to round 25 (April 2021-September 2021) and “2021 H2” refers to round 26 (October 2021 – March 2022).
Euro area firms regarded the macroeconomic environment as having adversely affected the availability of external financing (a net -29%, compared with 8% in the previous round) (see Chart 10 in section 4). Similarly, firms reported a small deterioration in their firm-specific outlook (-2%), while other factors related to the capital position and creditworthiness (around 16%) were still having a positive impact on access to finance. At the same time, a smaller percentage of firms signalled an improvement in the willingness of banks to provide credit (10%). The percentage was lower for SMEs (6%) than for large firms (17%).
Reflecting the completion of many public support programmes in the euro area, firms started to report that public financial support was playing a decreasing role in easing access to finance. The role of public financial support returned to a level in line with the survey rounds before the pandemic. In this respect SMEs were more pessimistic than large firms (-6% and -2%, respectively).
The overall indicator
[

]
of obstacles preventing euro area enterprises from accessing bank loans increased slightly to 7% (see Table 1, column 12 in this section). The percentage of firms that were discouraged from applying for bank loans also increased slightly at the euro area level (4%) and across countries. In this survey round a smaller percentage of firms has applied for a loan (down to 29% from 30%) with the rate for fully successful loan applications reaching 79%, almost unchanged.
A very high percentage of firms reported increases in bank interest rates, with similar developments across firm sizes and countries (up from 5% to 34%) (see Chart 15 in section 4). No comparable percentage had been observed in the survey replies to questions about price terms and conditions for bank financing since 2012. The very high percentage figure is consistent with the recent net widening of margins applied to bank loans, which was also signalled by banks in the April 2022 bank lending survey (BLS).

A comprehensive indicator of how firms perceive financing conditions shows a deterioration across size classes (see Chart B in this section). This indicator mainly covers changes in bank interest rates and other costs of bank financing (charges, fees and commissions) but is conditioned on firms’ characteristics and the willingness of banks to provide credit.
[

The recent deterioration (which is denoted by positive values of the indicator) is reported by about 20% of both SMEs and large firms – a percentage not seen since mid-2014.
Chart B
Financing conditions as perceived by euro area firms
(weighted scores)
Notes: Indicator obtained by factor analysis. Positive values indicate a deterioration in firms’ financing conditions. For details, see the box entitled “Financing conditions through the lens of euro area companies”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 8, ECB, 2021. The individual scores are weighted by size class, economic activity and country to reflect the economic structure of the underlying population of firms. The individual scores are standardised, so they have a range of between -1 and 1 and are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted balances in percentages. The first vertical grey line denotes the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions; the second vertical grey line denotes the start of the first series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO I) and the negative interest rate policy; the third vertical grey line denotes the start of TLTRO II and the corporate sector purchase programme; and the last vertical grey line denotes the start of the pandemic emergency purchase programme and TLTRO III. This coincides with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Latest observation: October 2021- March 2022.
Firms’ perceptions of financing conditions related to price terms and conditions are consistent with available information from the banking sector (see Chart C in this section). Chart C compares the dynamics of the indicator of financing conditions with two important aspects of the terms and conditions of loan contracts, namely the margins on average loans and the margins on riskier loans. These margins are defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates, as reported in the BLS. Since 2009, a widening (narrowing) of banks’ margins has been reflected in a worsening of (improvement in) financing conditions reported by firms. While the perceptions of changes in financing conditions of SMEs are broadly associated with changes in margins applied by banks on riskier loans, those of large companies mostly reflect changes in margins applied to average loans. In this survey round, however, the deterioration in financing conditions occurred mainly on account of a widening of margins on riskier loans for both size classes, reflecting assessments by banks that go beyond the creditworthiness of firms and are more focused on the intensification of economic risks.
Chart C
Banks’ lending conditions and firms’ perceived financing conditions
(net percentages for margins; weighted scores for price terms and conditions in percentages)
Sources: Euro area bank lending survey (BLS), ECB and European Commission Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE).
Notes: Positive values indicate a deterioration in firms’ financing conditions and a net widening of loan margins. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have fewer than 250 employees. For details, see the note to Chart B. Latest observation: October 2021- March 2022.
Looking ahead, euro area firms expect to see a decline in their access to external financing, especially financing from banks (see Chart 16 in section 5). In particular, a relatively high percentage of firms anticipated a deterioration in access to bank loans and credit lines (-15% and -10%, respectively) for the period April-September 2022. The expected deterioration was common to most countries and size classes, probably reflecting the prevailing economic uncertainty and a changing attitude on the part of banks.
Euro area companies reported higher selling prices over the last year (see Box 1 in the report). About three-quarters of euro area firms indicated that their prices increased “a little” (46%) or “a lot” (26%), and most expect price increases to continue over the next 12 months (47% by “a little”, 28% by “a lot”). Moreover, expectations of higher selling prices appear to be common across both large firms and SMEs of all sizes. Among countries, upward pressures on firm’s prices were more acute in Germany compared with the other three largest economies.
Higher selling prices are predominantly expected by firms in industry, construction, and trade sectors, while more moderate increases prevail in services (see Chart D in this section). Around 35% of firms in the former three sectors expect their prices to increase “a lot”. By contrast, the respective percentage for service firms is only 20%. Moreover, while 25% of service firms report no expectations of raising their prices in the near future, that percentage is significantly lower in the other sectors (12%, 15% and 13% for industry, construction and trade, respectively). Although there is no exact mapping between firms’ sector prices and HICP main sub-components, these survey results would be consistent with stronger price pressures in the non-energy industrial goods component of the HICP, with more limited price pressures in the services price sub-component.

QA2: Looking ahead, considering the markets where you sell your main products or services, would you say that in the next twelve months your selling prices…?
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to round 26 (October 2021-March 2022) of the survey.
Notes: DK stands for “Don’t know”.
Input costs is the most important factor currently influencing selling price expectations (“very” important for 74% of firms), followed by labour costs (60%), expected inflation (58%) and own demand (55%) (see Chart C in the box of the report). By contrast, factors such as market shares/competitors’ prices, the exchange rate and financing availability and costs play a much more limited role.
The perceived importance of expected inflation as a factor in selling prices has increased compared with 2020. The significant rise in inflation since 2020 also appears to have increased the influence of expected inflation on selling prices, a factor which 58% of firms now report as “very” important (up from 30% in 2020).
Overall, the survey results suggest that the recovery in economic activity among euro area enterprises after the pandemic continued over the past six months. However, firms’ profitability was reduced by surging input costs.
Despite the uncertainty related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, euro area firms still expect higher turnover, albeit to a lesser extent than in the previous survey round. Expectations of future turnover seem to have been dented somewhat at the very start of this survey round, immediately after the start of the war in Ukraine, but remained relatively stable thereafter during the fieldwork period up to mid-April. At the same time, upward pressures on selling prices are expected to continue in the coming months, due mainly to higher input prices but additionally to inflation expectations.
Euro area firms also signalled a significant tightening of financing conditions, with increases in price terms and conditions for bank loans. While the availability of bank financing was broadly in line with firms’ demand for financing, firms expect a deterioration in the availability of funds in the near future.
2 The financial situation of euro area firms
2.1 Business activity continues to improve among euro area enterprises
Reflecting some resilience to the impact of the war in Ukraine, euro area enterprises continued to report higher turnover (see Chart 1). For the period from October 2021 to March 2022, a net percentage of euro area enterprises reported increasing turnover (25%, up from 24% in the previous survey round). That net percentage suggests a continuation of the recovery in business activity from the historical lows recorded in 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with some resilience to the economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Chart 1
Changes in the income situation of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 3-26 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2021-March 2022) for all firms and to rounds 19-26 (April 2018 -September 2018 to October 2021-March 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: Net percentages are the difference between the percentage of enterprises reporting an increase for a given factor and the percentage reporting a decrease. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
The recovery in turnover is widespread across firm sizes, although it seems to have taken place at a faster pace for larger companies. The net percentage of large firms reporting turnover growth rose to 51% in this round (up from 41%). Among SMEs the figure was 35% (up from 32%) for medium-sized companies and 17% (down from 21%) for small firms; it was only among micro firms that a net percentage signalled lower turnover over the past six months (-5% compared with 3%).
At the same time, euro area enterprises also reported significant increases in materials and energy costs, as well as labour costs. A very high proportion of euro area firms reported rises in materials and energy costs (89%, up from 73%) and in labour costs (66%, up from 45%), with increases being reported for all firm sizes. Similarly, euro area firms reported an increase in interest rate expenses, with higher net percentages across all firm sizes.
Despite the resilient business activity, higher costs have weighed on firms’ profits, but with important differences across firm sizes. While a positive net percentage of large companies continued to report an increase in profits (15%, down from 20% in the previous round), SMEs reported a deterioration in profits in net terms (-15% overall, and -1%, -14% and -23% for medium-sized, small and micro SMEs respectively).
Across countries, trends in firms’ business activity have followed very similar patterns over the past six months (see Chart 19 in Annex 1). Firms in the largest euro area countries showed a very similar recovery in turnover. However, while the widespread increases in labour and other costs led to a net percentage of companies continuing to report a decline in profits for the euro area aggregate, Spanish and Italian enterprises were particularly affected (-12% for both compared with -4% for the euro area as a whole).
Chart 2
Changes in the debt situation and real decisions of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 11-26 of the survey (March 2014-September 2014 to October 2021-March 2022) for all firms and to rounds 19-26 (April 2018 -September 2018 to October 2021-March 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
The balance sheets of euro area enterprises improved slightly over the past six months (see Chart 2). A net percentage of euro area firms indicated a decline in their debt-to-assets ratios (-3%, unchanged from the previous round), most likely reflecting a continuation of the recovery in business activity after the pandemic lows. Debt-to-assets ratios were reported to have declined for firms of all sizes.
Developments in firms’ debt-to-assets ratios show diverging patterns across euro area countries. Looking at the four largest economies, German firms continued to report lower debt-to-assets ratios in net terms in this survey round in line with the aggregate at euro area level, while in the other large countries, enterprises continued to report increases, particularly in Italy (4%, up from 2%) (see Chart 20 in Annex 1 for other countries).
Firms’ investment and hiring decisions have also benefited from the continued recovery in economic activity. A net percentage of euro area enterprises reported increases in fixed investment (16%, up from 13%), inventories and working capital (15%, up from 10%) and number of employees (16%, up from 12%). However, while advances in fixed investment and inventories are widespread across all firm sizes, the recovery in employment seems to be stronger for larger firms, whereas micro SMEs are continuing to report an actual reduction in employees.
The recovery in fixed investment expenses, in inventories and working capital and in employment remained widespread across countries. In net terms, the percentages of firms reporting increases in fixed investment ranged between 8% and 20%, while for inventories and working capital expenses they ranged between 8% and 22%, and for employment between 11% and 18% in the four largest euro area economies.
The financial vulnerability of euro area enterprises eased overall, but differences across firm sizes are noticeable (see Chart 3). The financial vulnerability indicator, a comprehensive indicator of firms’ financial situation
[
6
]
, suggests that, as in the previous survey round, 4% of euro area enterprises encountered major difficulties in running their businesses and servicing their debts over the past six months. That overall percentage masks differences between large firms (of which only 2% can be considered financially vulnerable, down from 4%), and SMEs (of which 5% are vulnerable, up from 4% in the previous survey round). Moreover, financial vulnerability remains somewhat above its average levels prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.
At the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of profitable firms (i.e. those that are more likely to be resilient to adverse shocks) also declined to 4% overall (from 6%) (Chart 21 in Annex 1 shows the results at country level).
Chart 3
Vulnerable and profitable enterprises in the euro area
(percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 3-26 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2021-March 2022) for all firms and to rounds 18-26 (October 2017-March 2018 to October 2021-March 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Notes: For definitions, see footnote 7. The data included in the chart refer to Question 2 of the survey.
Looking at firm size, smaller enterprises continued to be more vulnerable than larger companies. While the percentage of medium-sized SMEs that can be considered vulnerable remained at 3%, it increased to 5% (from 4%) for small firms, and to 7% (from 5%) for micro firms. The percentage of firms that can instead be characterised as “profitable” declined across all size categories, although it remains above the lows reached during 2020.
Trends in the financial vulnerability indicator diverged across countries (see Chart 21 in Annex 1). The percentage of vulnerable companies rose somewhat in Spain (7%, up from 6%) and Italy (6%, up from 5%), while it decreased slightly in France (4%, down from 5%) and Germany (3%, down from 4%). By contrast, profitability decreased across the four largest economies in this survey round, in line with the euro area aggregate, with the share of profitable firms ranging between 3% of firms in Italy and 5% in France.
For the second time in recent years, the questionnaire included some additional questions regarding the price expectations and price setting behaviour of euro area enterprises. Box 1 summarises the main results.
Box 1
Ad-hoc questions – Price expectations among euro area enterprises
Firms are important economic agents when it comes to determining inflation dynamics. This is because firms take many decisions that influence macroeconomic outcomes. These include decisions on wages and selling prices, on how much to invest and on how many people to employ. Firms’ price setting behaviour is therefore of significant interest for monetary policy. However, information about firms’ pricing practices remains relatively scarce compared with that from other economic agents. To help better understand of pricing practices among euro area corporations, this survey round introduced a few additional questions on recent price changes (i.e. those over the past 12 months) and expected price changes (i.e. those over the next 12 months) at firm level, along with questions on the importance of factors taken into account in determining those price expectations over the next 12 months.
Euro area companies reported higher selling prices over the past year (Chart A). About three-quarters of euro area firms indicated that their prices increased “a little” (46%) or “a lot” (26%), while the proportion of firms for which prices remained unchanged was more limited (22%), and only very few reported lower prices (4%).
Among the largest economies, upward pressures on firms’ prices were more acute in Germany than in the other three largest economies. While firms in the euro area as a whole and in the largest four countries predominantly characterised price increases over the last 12 months as relatively moderate (between 40% and 49% of firms described prices as “increasing by a little”), 31% of German firms reported higher increases (”by a lot”), which was above the euro area average (26%). In the other large countries, the respective percentages were 22% in Italy and Spain and 18% in France. Meanwhile, the proportion of firms reporting unchanged prices ranged from 16% in Germany to 31% in Spain, with the euro area average standing at 22%. These price developments suggest a stronger pass-through of input costs among German companies than in other countries, which may help explain the diverging developments in profits across countries reported in the previous section. By contrast, differences across firm sizes in the euro area as a whole appear to be limited and broadly reflect the same qualitative pattern as that described above.

Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to round 26 (October 2021-March 2022) of the survey.

Upward pressures on firms’ prices are expected to continue (Chart B). Over the next 12 months, the overwhelming majority of euro area enterprises expect their prices to increase (47% by “a little”, 28% by “a lot”), with a lower proportion expecting their prices to remain unchanged (18%) or even to decrease a little (3%). The expectations of higher selling prices overall appear to be quite similar across firm sizes, and they are widespread among both large firms and SMEs of all sizes.

Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to round 26 (October 2021-March 2022) of the survey.
Note: DK stands for “Don’t know”.
To help further understand the forces behind the expected price changes reported above, firms were also asked to report the importance of several factors when setting their prices. The factors range from demand for the firm’s own products/services, costs (for inputs, financing and labour) and market shares/competitors’ prices to expected inflation and exchange rate dynamics.
Costs (of both inputs and labour) and expected inflation are the main factors behind higher expected selling prices among euro area companies, followed by own demand (Chart C). Input costs are the most important factor currently influencing selling price expectations (“very” important for 74% of firms), followed by labour costs (60%), expected inflation (58%) and own demand (55%). By contrast, factors such as market shares/competitors’ prices, the exchange rate and the availability and costs of financing play a much more limited role.
Chart C
Factors influencing selling prices for euro area enterprises (2022 situation vs 2020 pre-COVID-19)
(percentages of respondents)
QA3: How important do you expect the following factors to be when setting or changing your selling prices over the next twelve months?
Base: All enterprises. Figures refer to round 22 (October 2019-March 2020) and round 26 (October 2021-March 2022) of the survey.
Changes in the relative importance assigned to different factors over time offer additional insights into the nature of increases in selling price expectations among firms. In the case of the SAFE, similar questions were asked two years ago, in early 2020. Labour and input costs were already the main source of upward pressures on selling prices before the pandemic in early 2020, while the impact of expected inflation has increased more recently.
More specifically, the share of firms reporting that labour costs are relevant has remained similar relative to the previous survey (“very” important for around 60% of firms and “moderately” important for about 33%), while the corresponding value for input costs has risen further (reported as “very” important by 74% of firms now, up from 51% in early 2020). The significant rise in inflation since 2020 also appears to have increased the influence of expected inflation on selling prices, a factor which 58% of firms now report as “very” important (up from 30% in 2020). By contrast, developments in own demand and in competitors’ prices/market share now play a smaller role than in 2020 when it comes to selling price expectations. The exchange rate and financing costs/availability continue to have more limited influence on expected selling prices, being rated as “not important” by around 40% of firms. These qualitative findings are broadly shared across firm sizes, although input costs and expected inflation seem to be more relevant to large companies than to SMEs, while the opposite seems to hold for financing costs.
Price increases are expected to remain stronger in Germany than in other large countries. More than a third of German firms expect their prices to increase by “a lot” (36%), while for the other large countries the proportion ranges between 21% (Spain and Italy) and 26% (France). Almost half of firms in all countries expect their prices to increase by “a little” (ranging between 44% in Germany to 49% in France and Italy). Meanwhile, about a quarter of reporting firms (ranging between 18% in Germany and 30% in Spain) expect constant or decreasing prices.
2.2 Euro area enterprises remain more concerned about staff availability and production costs and less about access to finance
The availability of skilled labour and the rise in production costs have become the main concerns, in relative terms, for euro area enterprises (see Chart 4). Over the past six months, concerns about the availability of skilled labour continued to rise among euro area firms (signalled by a net 30% of firms, up from 29%). Concerns regarding production costs also rose (18%, up from 13%), becoming the second most important concern for euro area enterprises. By contrast, difficulty in finding customers (16%, down from 18%), regulation (8%, down from 11%) and competition (8%, down from 9%) moderated with respect to the previous survey round. Finally, SMEs reported that they were relatively less concerned about access to finance (unchanged at 6%), broadly in line with pre-pandemic percentages.
Chart 4
The most important problems faced by euro area enterprises
(percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 19-26 of the survey (April 2018-September 2018 to October 2021-March 2022).
Notes: The data included in the chart refer to Question 0b of the survey.
Overall, concerns are broadly similar across euro area enterprises, regardless of their size. Concerns regarding production costs rose significantly for firms of all sizes, and large firms tended to report somewhat stronger concerns about shortages of skilled staff than smaller companies, possibly on account of their more advanced recovery from the trough in economic activity. Lower concerns about regulation, competition and access to finance were common across all firms, regardless of their size.
The main concerns among firms followed broadly similar patterns across euro area countries, although some cross-country heterogeneity remained (see Chart 22 in Annex 1). Looking at the different factors in relative terms, firms’ concerns about higher production costs rose significantly in the four largest euro area countries this round. However, the lack of skilled staff remained the biggest concern, particularly for German companies (signalled by a net 38%), although it was somewhat less of a problem in Spain and Italy (14% and 21% respectively). At the same time, Spanish firms reported more difficulty finding customers (20%), while this was significantly less of a concern among French and Italian enterprises (12% and 16% respectively).
Focusing on the importance of access to finance as a problem on a scale of 1 to 10 offers additional insights into concerns regarding the evolution of euro area enterprises (see Chart 5). Scores remained within the low range of concerns for both large and SMEs, but their weighted averages rose marginally from the previous round. This suggests that, although in relative terms few companies (and less than in the previous round) ranked access to finance as their most important concern (compared with others as shown in Chart 4 above), when considering the score assigned to access to finance (on a scale of 1 to 10), firms’ responses point to a low but marginally growing concern about their access to finance, possibly related, for example, to the increases in interest rates and deterioration in conditions for bank loans that they report (see Section 4).

Notes: Enterprises were asked to indicate how important a specific problem was on a scale of 1 (not at all important) to 10 (extremely important). On the chart, the scale has been divided into three categories: low (1-3), medium (4-6) and high importance (7-10). The weighted average score is an average of the responses using the weighted number of respondents. The data included in the chart refer to Question 0b of the survey.
3 Firms’ needs for and uses of external financing
3.1 Moderate increases in demand for external financing
In net terms, firms reported some moderate increases in the demand for bank loans and credit lines at the euro area level, with credit demand now reaching pre-pandemic levels (see Chart 6). A net 5% of companies reported higher demand for bank loans
[
7
]
(up from 2% in the previous survey round), while 7% reported increased demand for credit lines (up from 4%). The results are in line with the overall growth in bank loans recorded since last October in the euro area, although they show some heterogeneity across size classes and countries. While demand for bank loans was similar for SMEs and large companies (4% and 6%, respectively), the increase in demand for credit lines was reported more often by SMEs (9%) than for large firms (5%). At the same time, net demand for trade credit and leasing or hire-purchase continued to increase (12% and 13% respectively), as did demand for other loans (8%), all signalling the need for firms to diversify external finance.

Changes in external financing needs of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 19-26 of the survey (April 2018-September 2018 to October 2021-March 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 of the survey.
Demand for bank loans and credit lines continued to increase at a slower pace across most countries after the peak reached during the first phase of the pandemic (see Chart 24 in Annex 1). The increase in net demand for bank loans was higher for Italian firms (10%), while needs for credit lines were more similar across countries.
3.2 Euro area firms used financing primarily for fixed investment and for inventories and working capital
Financing from external and internal sources continued to be used mainly for fixed investment and for inventories and working capital (see Chart 7). Around 47% of euro area firms mentioned using financing for fixed investment, while 42% reported using it for inventories and working capital. After the decline during the pandemic, fixed investment and the hiring and training of employees rebounded in the last three survey rounds to reach levels close to those prevailing before the pandemic. Across size classes, more large companies than SMEs were using external finance for fixed investment (60% compared with 40%) and for working capital and inventories (50% compared with 37%), which might be due to higher capacity on the part of large companies to build up precautionary inventories.

Looking at the largest euro area countries, German firms continued to stand out in terms of their use of funds for fixed investment (59%), while Spanish firms continued to use financing more for inventories and working capital (52%) (see Chart 25 in Annex 1).
4 Availability of external financing for firms in the euro area
4.1 Lower availability of external financing, mainly on account of the deterioration in the economic outlook
4.1.1 Improvements in the availability of bank loans lower across firm sizes and countries, only marginally compensating for increases in demand
Fewer firms reported improvements in the availability of most external financing sources relevant for their business (see Chart 8).
[

]
For bank loans and credit lines, the net percentages of respondents indicating an improvement in availability declined to 5% and 6% respectively (both down from 10% in the previous survey round). In addition, fewer firms signalled increases in the availability of trade credit and equity (2% for both). Other loans (mainly informal loans from family and friends, a related enterprise or shareholders) and leasing remained important sources of available external funding as an alternative to banking and market-based finance.

Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. The figures refer to rounds 19-26 of the survey (April 2018-September 2018 to October 2021-March 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 9 of the survey.
Firms across size classes pointed to similar developments. Indeed, in this survey round, both SMEs and large firms reported smaller improvements in the availability of most financing products. However, the net percentage of large companies indicating improvements in availability remained higher, reinforcing the disparities in access to external financing across firm sizes.
Fewer firms indicated improvements in the availability of bank loans across countries (see Chart 26 in Annex 1). The net percentage of respondents indicating improvements in the availability of bank loans declined in the largest euro area countries, except in France, where a slightly higher percentage of firms reported increases with respect to the previous survey round.
Improvements in firms’ access to external funds only marginally compensated for the corresponding increases in their financing needs (see Chart 9). In the euro area as a whole, the external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the supply of external financing – reached 1% (compared with -4% in the previous round). Across size classes, large companies continued to report a sufficient supply of external finance to cover their demand (i.e. a negative financing gap, -2% compared with -7%). By contrast, SMEs indicated a small gap in their ability to finance demand, which was the reverse of their previous situation (2% compared with -2%). At the level of individual euro area countries, the financing gap remained negative only in Germany (-1%), as it became positive in Italy (1%) (see also Chart 27 in Annex 1).
Chart 9
Changes in the external financing gaps reported by euro area enterprises
(weighted net balances)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant. Respondents replying with “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-26 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2021-March 2022).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages. The data included in the chart refer to Question 5 and Question 9.
4.1.2 Euro area enterprises perceived that a weaker economic outlook was negatively affecting their ability to obtain external finance
A deteriorating outlook for economic activity was reported as an important factor affecting access to finance (see Chart 10). In this survey round, euro area firms felt that changes in the general economic outlook had had a strong negative impact on their access to finance (-29%, from 8%). At the same time, enterprises reported a small deterioration in firm-specific factors, such as outlook in terms of profits and turnover (-2%, down from 20%). Across size classes, the factors related to the macroeconomic environment had a similar negative impact among SMEs and large firms, whereas firms’ specific factors weighed more negatively for SMEs. By contrast, factors related to capital position (15%, down from 19%) and creditworthiness (16%, down from 18%) were still having a positive impact on access to finance. This might reflect the ongoing efforts of companies to restore their equity capital buffers and thus become more resilient to economic shocks.

(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 19-26 of the survey (April 2018-September 2018 to October 2021-March 2022).
Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 11 of the survey.
Among the largest euro area countries, the most pessimistic perceptions on the general economic environment came from Spanish and German companies. In particular, 38% of Spanish and 32% of German companies reported a net negative impact from the general economic outlook (up from a previous positive impact of 6% and 5% respectively) (see Chart 28 in Annex 1).
Euro area firms perceived that banks’ willingness to provide credit was still improving, but to a lesser extent than in the previous survey round (see Chart 11). In net terms, 10% of firms reported an increase in banks’ willingness to lend (down from 16% in the previous round), with a lower percentage for SMEs (6%) than for large firms (17%). At country level, the reduction was higher in Spain (7%, down from 17%), while French enterprises reported an increase (11%, up from 9%) (see Chart 29 in Annex 1).
Reflecting the completion of many public support programmes in the euro area, firms started to report that public financial support was playing a decreasing role in easing access to finance (see Chart 11). The role of public financial support returned to a level in line with the survey rounds before the pandemic. 5% of euro area firms no longer considered grants or subsidised loans to be important tools for obtaining access to finance. Looking at firm size, SMEs were more pessimistic than large firms in this respect. At country level, only French firms continued to signal positive changes in the impact of public policy (see Chart 29 in Annex 1).

Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 11.
4.2 Small increases in financing obstacles, mainly among SMEs
The percentage of firms reporting obstacles to obtaining a bank loan increased marginally (see Chart 12, panel a). Among enterprises that judged bank loans to be relevant for their funding, 7% faced obstacles when obtaining a loan (up from 6% in the previous survey round), with the increase mainly due to SMEs (8%). Looking at the different components of the indicator for financing obstacles, the percentage of firms that were discouraged from applying for a loan also increased slightly at the euro area level (to 4% from 3%) and across countries (see Chart 30 in Appendix 1).
Chart 12
Obstacles to obtaining a bank loan
(percentages of respondents)
Panel a: Euro area enterprises

Panel b: Euro area SMEs and large enterprises
Base: Enterprises for which bank loans (including subsidised bank loans) are relevant. The figures refer to rounds 3-26 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2021-March 2022).
Notes: Financing obstacles are defined here as the total of the percentages of enterprises reporting (i) loan applications that were rejected, (ii) loan applications for which only a limited amount was granted, (iii) loan applications that resulted in an offer that was declined by the enterprise because the borrowing costs were too high and (iv) a decision not to apply for a loan for fear of rejection (discouraged borrowers).
The percentage of firms applying for bank loans continued to decline after the peak reached at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while self-financing continued to increase (see Chart 13). According to figures based only on enterprises that deemed bank loans to be relevant for their business, 29% of firms reported having applied for a loan (down from 30%). Only 23% of SMEs applied, whereas 45% did not apply because they had sufficient internal funds available. By contrast, even though a similar percentage of large companies signalled sufficient internal funds, they still tended to apply more often for bank loans than smaller-sized companies (37%). Most of the firms that applied were successful in obtaining the full amount requested, whether they were SMEs (71%) or large companies (87%) (see Chart 14).

4.3 Significant tightening of financing conditions, with increases in price terms and conditions for bank loans
In this survey round, a very high percentage of firms reported increases in interest rates on bank loans together with some deterioration in other costs of financing, with similar developments across firm sizes and countries. The net percentage reporting such increases jumped to 34% (up from 5% in the previous round) (see Chart 15). No comparable percentage had been observed in the survey replies since 2012. The very high percentage is consistent with the recent net widening of margins applied to bank loans, also reported by banks in the April 2022 BLS. At the same time, the net percentage of firms signalling increases in other costs of financing (i.e. charges, fees and commissions) continued to increase, reaching 37% compared with 29%. The rises in bank interest rates and other costs of bank loans appear to be broadly similar across SMEs and large firms. Firms also reported stricter collateral requirements, while fewer firms indicated increases in the maturity of loans, with no changes in the size of loans.
Among the largest euro area countries, more Italian, Spanish and French firms reported increases in bank interest rates (see Chart 33 in Appendix 1). 41% of Italian firms, 40% of Spanish firms and 39% of French firms indicated that banks had increased bank interest rates (up from 3%,19% and -1% respectively).

5 Expectations regarding access to finance and turnover
5.1 Firms expect a deterioration in their access to most forms of external financing in the near future
Euro area firms were quite pessimistic about the availability of most sources of external financing, especially financing from banks (see Chart 16). In particular, a relatively high percentage of firms reported a deterioration in expected access to bank loans and credit lines (-15% and -10%, respectively) over the next six months. The expected deterioration was common to size classes and most countries (see Chart 34 in Annex 1), reflecting the prevailing economic uncertainty and a changing attitude on the part of banks. Similarly, firms indicated a deterioration in their access to trade credit (-13%, down from 5%), while the improvement expected in the last survey round for equity issuance was reduced to 4% from 9%.

Notes: See the notes to Chart 1. The data included in the chart refer to Question 9 and Question 23 of the survey.
To partly compensate for the expected reduction in availability of external finance, firms plan to use retained earnings to finance their future business, albeit to a lesser extent than in the previous survey round (5%, down from 17%) (see Chart 17). Across size classes, a smaller percentage of SMEs (3%) expected to use internal funds than large firms (7%), in line with the differences reported in their business turnover (see Section 2).

Meanwhile, the expected changes in turnover, while somewhat lower than in the previous round, are still positive and seem to be fairly resilient to the economic repercussions of the war in Ukraine (see Chart 18 in the report). A net 34% of euro area firms (down from 44% in the previous survey round) continue to expect an increase in turnover over the next six months. Expectations of future turnover seem to have been dented somewhat at the very start of this survey round, immediately after the start of the war in Ukraine, but remained relatively stable thereafter during the fieldwork period up to mid-April. A positive but somewhat less optimistic outlook for future turnover was reported among both large companies (47% compared with 57%) and SMEs (27% compared with 36%), as well as in the four largest euro area economies (see Chart 36 in Appendix 1).

Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap.

Impact of war on energy prices, inflation and growth amplifies existing vulnerabilities
Market reaction to invasion largely orderly, but risk of further correction remains
Banks face weaker profitability after strong recovery in 2021
Financial stability conditions in the euro area have worsened as the Russian invasion of Ukraine leads to higher energy and commodity prices and increases risks to euro area inflation and growth, the May 2022 Financial Stability Review (FSR) published today by the European Central Bank (ECB) concludes.
“The terrible war in Ukraine has brought immense human suffering,” ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos said. “It has also increased financial stability risks through its impact on virtually all aspects of economic activity and financing conditions.”
The market reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been largely orderly. However, prices for commodities and energy have remained elevated and volatile, which has caused some stress in derivatives markets for these products. Despite recent adjustments, some assets remain at risk of further corrections should the growth outlook weaken further and/or inflation turn out to be significantly higher than expected.
Vulnerabilities may increase due to the uncertain path of the Russia-Ukraine war and shifting expectations of policy normalisation in advanced economies. Other potential global developments, such as a broader resurgence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, weaknesses in key emerging market economies or a sharper slowdown in Chinese economic activity, could also affect risks to growth and inflation.
Euro area non-financial corporations face challenges from rising input prices and a more clouded economic outlook. This may increase corporate defaults, especially for firms and sectors that have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. Moreover, highly indebted firms and those with lower credit ratings may struggle with tighter financing conditions.
Euro area house prices have continued rising and mortgage lending growth has been accelerating, although a widespread extension of fixed-rate mortgages should shield many borrowers from higher interest rates in the near term.
The profitability prospects for European banks have weakened again, following a strong recovery in 2021. The potential impact of increased energy prices, higher inflation and weaker growth could cause asset quality risks to materialise. At the same time, only a few banks have significant direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and a recent vulnerability analysis carried out by the ECB indicates that the euro area banking system should remain resilient even under severely adverse economic scenarios.
Significant flows have taken place from investment funds that manage corporate bond portfolios to funds that manage sovereign bond exposures, as well as from growth to value equity funds. So far, these shifts have not been systemically disruptive, but the sector remains vulnerable due to its low liquidity, high duration risk and high exposure to bonds issued by weak corporates. Some funds also face additional risks from excessive leverage in derivatives or from investments in crypto-assets.
The resilience of the financial system would benefit from a more effective capital buffer framework. As recently proposed by the ECB, higher buffers that can be released in periods of stress would improve the ability of banks to absorb losses and maintain lending. Regulation to address risks in the non-bank financial sector, stemming for example from liquidity mismatches, leverage or margining practices, also needs to be strengthened.

,"The May 2022 Financial Stability Review (FSR) has been prepared against the backdrop of the devastating invasion of Ukraine. We do not yet know how the war will be resolved. But we do know that the human suffering it has caused is enormous. We hope for peace.
This war is also affecting the economy, in Europe and beyond. The invasion and the associated uncertainty have prompted some repricing in global financial markets, albeit with much less turmoil than seen in March 2020, and dampened the confidence of businesses and consumers that are only just emerging from the tight restrictions imposed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Higher energy and commodity prices are pushing up inflation and slowing the economic recovery. Elevated volatility has highlighted some liquidity risks, notably in some commodity derivatives markets. However, the main threat to euro area financial stability comes from the impact through macroeconomic channels. This implies additional challenges for indebted businesses at a point in time when countries’ fiscal space is very limited and support may need to be more targeted than the broad fiscal policy response to the pandemic.
With these developments in mind, this FSR assesses financial stability vulnerabilities and their implications for financial markets, debt sustainability, bank resilience, the non-bank financial sector and macroprudential policies.
This issue of the FSR also includes two special features on topics that are increasingly part of our routine financial stability assessment at the ECB. The first focuses on recent advances in the monitoring of financial stability risks stemming from climate change, building on previous special features on the topic. The second special feature explores risks arising from crypto-assets – which have been increasing over time, as this sector grows both in its size and in its integration with the core financial system.
This issue of the FSR has been prepared with the involvement of the ESCB Financial Stability Committee, which assists the decision-making bodies of the ECB in the ful?lment of their tasks. The FSR exists to promote awareness of systemic risks among policymakers, the ?nancial industry and the public at large, with the ultimate goal of promoting financial stability.
Luis de Guindos
Vice-President of the European Central Bank
Overview
Higher prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war, weaken the recovery and increase global risks
Financial stability conditions have deteriorated, as the post-pandemic recovery has been tested by higher inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since late 2021, rising inflationary pressures have threatened to slow the momentum of the recovery in 2022. Upside risks to euro area inflation and downside risks to growth rose sharply following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war (Chart 1, panel a). In particular, large rises in commodity and energy prices (Chart 1, panel b) and ongoing global supply chain pressures are expected to prolong the period of elevated inflation. The course and consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war are still hard to predict. While peace could reverse some pressures, a protracted conflict could imply sustained higher inflation and even lower growth outturns than currently expected. Risks to inflation, growth and global financial conditions could also be triggered by other global events, such as a broader resurgence of the coronavirus (COVID-19), emerging market weakness or a sharper economic slowdown in China (Box 4).

Higher inflation and lower growth could increase market volatility and challenge debt servicing capacity as financing costs rise. The consequences of the war and the shift to a lower-growth, higher-inflation environment affect virtually every aspect of economic activity and financing conditions. In turn, these developments might not only amplify, but could also trigger the materialisation of pre-existing financial stability vulnerabilities identified in previous issues of the FSR. These include heightened debt sustainability concerns in non-financial sectors or the possibility of corrections in both financial and tangible asset markets (Box 3).
Initial risk-off reaction in markets largely orderly, but asset price correction concerns remain
The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a large but, in most cases, short-lived market reaction. In early 2022, markets, positioning for solid growth, a temporary spike in inflation and relatively modest policy tightening, saw a repricing in global equity and bond markets. The outbreak of the war, which increased the risk of a higher-inflation, lower-growth scenario, saw market volatility increase, credit spreads widen and equity indices decline (Chart 2, panels a and b). The market response was substantial, but more modest than at the onset of the pandemic. Movements in commodity markets were most pronounced, as Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers. Euro area assets, given greater proximity and links to Russia and Ukraine, experienced larger losses than US assets. By the end of March, euro area markets had recovered most of the initial losses, but commodity prices remained elevated. Over the course of April and May, concerns about the global growth outlook and central banks’ response to higher inflation rates led to renewed weakness in risky asset valuations.

Further corrections in financial markets could be triggered by an escalation of the war, even weaker global growth or if monetary policy needs to adjust faster than expected. Despite recent asset price corrections, valuations remain stretched in the light of the deterioration in macro-fundamentals, and further sharp corrections are a risk. Such corrections could be triggered by a further escalation of the war, emerging market stresses or by more persistent inflation than currently foreseen, which might prompt faster monetary policy normalisation by major central banks. Higher interest rates could challenge the valuations of riskier assets, such as equities. Euro area sovereign and high-yield credit spreads have widened over the course of 2022. Spread increases are in part related to the rise in underlying risk-free rates, as the latter mechanically have a larger impact on the earnings and budget deficits of more indebted firms and sovereigns.
Large shifts in commodity prices and related margin requirements have posed challenges to liquidity management for some derivative market participants. Commodity derivatives markets are used by a wide range of firms, including energy producers, suppliers and distributors, and users, to manage risks arising from volatile commodity prices, and enable them to fulfil contracts with corporates and households. In response to the recent rise in commodity price volatility, central clearing counterparties (CCPs) and clearing members have increased the initial margins for commodity derivatives (Chart 2, panel c). Margin requirements must be met by posting cash or highly liquid collateral. For some firms, these liquidity requirements may become prohibitive, while for others, the cost of hedging may have started to outweigh the perceived benefit. As a result, some firms may choose to reduce their hedging activities, or switch to contracts with lower collateralisation needs, including non-centrally cleared derivatives (Chapter 2). In the latter case, both the firm and the counterparty could be more exposed to counterparty credit risk. Sufficient margining is an important safeguard in the financial system. But recent developments do raise the question of whether margining practices (including those between the clearing member and their client) might be unnecessarily procyclical, and whether they are sufficiently transparent (Chapter 5).
Investment funds saw manageable outflows following the invasion, but euro area non-banks remain vulnerable to a further market correction, given high duration, credit and liquidity risk. Limited aggregate exposure to Russian and Ukrainian assets meant that only a few of the more specialist investment funds were suspended. That said, since early 2022, there has been a rotation from corporate to sovereign bond funds, as well as from growth to value equity funds. After the start of the war, there had been renewed interest in inflation-protected bond funds in anticipation of higher inflation, and in commodity-related equity funds in the light of the surge in energy prices. These trends slowed down or reversed again in late April in line with weaker performance of these asset classes (Chart 3, panel a). Some duration risk for non-banks has started to materialise in recent quarters, and further valuation losses may arise. Non-banks also have large exposures to weaker corporates which may be especially vulnerable to higher inflation and lower growth. The risk that investment funds could amplify a market correction due to fire sales remains, given low liquidity buffers (Chart 3, panel b). For some non-banks, additional vulnerabilities stem from their excessive synthetic leverage via derivatives (Box 7) or investments in crypto-assets, where growing institutional investor interest is deepening the linkages with the mainstream financial system (Special Feature B). In the medium term, however, a higher interest rate environment could reduce the non-bank sector’s incentives to search for yield and benefit the insurance and pension fund sector because of its negative duration gap, thereby mitigating overall financial stability risks (Chapter 4).

Input price increases and higher financing cost add strains for more indebted firms and sovereigns
Euro area corporates face renewed headwinds as input prices have soared and the economic outlook has become more clouded. A solid economic recovery helped measures of aggregate corporate vulnerability to improve towards the end of 2021 (Chapter 1.3). Gross profits recovered to 7% above pre-pandemic levels, while policy support measures have kept corporate insolvencies at historic lows. However, a weaker economic growth outlook, coupled with growing margin pressure as a result of soaring input prices, has led to some increase in expected corporate default rates (Chart 4, panel a).
There is a sizeable cohort of more vulnerable and pandemic-strained firms, some of which are also sensitive to commodity prices. The most vulnerable corporates which are more indebted, less liquid and have lower sales levels might face particular challenges in the event of a pronounced economic slowdown (Box 1). Higher energy and commodity prices could hurt activity in economic sectors which have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic, such as air transport, accommodation, and food and beverages (Chart 4, panel b), or which have low pricing power to pass on higher costs (Chapter 2). These vulnerabilities are compounded by the prospect of tighter financing conditions that would adversely affect the debt servicing capacity of lower-rated firms in particular. This could also fuel corporate downgrade risk, as the bulk of issuance activity in recent years has taken place in the lowest investment grade bucket (BBB).

Notes: Panel a: European speculative-grade default rates forecast by Moody’s Analytics as at January 2022 (solid lines) and April 2022 (dotted lines). The baseline forecasts incorporate low refinancing risk and healthy corporate fundamentals. The optimistic scenario builds on the favourable baseline, expecting markets to remain very supportive of speculative-grade issuers in 2022, while showing exceptional demand for high-yield debt in the search for yield. By contrast, the pessimistic scenario acknowledges a particularly weak ratings mix among European speculative-grade issuers. For more details on the different scenarios, see the Moody’s website. There is a structural break in the time series of realised rates as of March 2022, as defaulting and non-defaulting Russian issuers whose ratings were recently withdrawn have been excluded.

The red vertical line represents the median usage of energy inputs as share of total output across all sectors of economic activity. Out of 42 NACE sectors, 24 are shown in the chart.
Euro area fiscal positions also face challenges as they now encounter a weaker recovery and tighter financial conditions. In 2021, as the euro area economy began recovering from the COVID-19 shock, governments gradually withdraw the stimulus they provided during the pandemic. As a result, fiscal positions in 2022 are expected to improve compared to 2021. However, the repercussions of the war in Ukraine may create new draws on public finances. While immediate stress in euro area sovereign bond markets remained low, short-term fiscal pressures have increased in a number of countries (Chart 5, panel a). This is attributable to measures aimed at cushioning the adverse impact of higher energy prices on households and corporates, as well as the cost of managing the flow of refugees and higher defence spending in some countries. Market participants estimate the associated additional fiscal impact for the largest euro area countries at around 1.2 percentage points of GDP on average. Also, where coupled with lower economic growth than previously anticipated, higher interest rates may translate into higher refinancing needs (Chart 5, panel b). This could put sovereign debt dynamics on an unfavourable trajectory, especially in higher-debt countries.
Additional fiscal space to cushion the economy from future shocks may have become more limited in some euro area countries. This, coupled with debt sustainability concerns, could contribute to a reassessment of sovereign risk by market participants and spur fragmentation pressures in sovereign bond markets. That said, countries with higher sovereign risk have taken advantage of low rates to prolong their debt maturity profile, which reduces their vulnerability to abrupt changes in market sentiment. To the extent that higher sovereign vulnerabilities coincide with fragilities in the corporate and banking sectors, risks materialising in any of these sectors (in isolation or combination) may lead to adverse feedback loops between sovereign, banks and corporates (Box 1).

The size of the bubble represents the general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021. Panel b: the aggregate of higher-debt countries includes euro area countries with a 2021 general government debt-to-GDP ratio above 90%. The lower-debt aggregate includes the remaining euro area countries. The threshold of 90% of GDP for sovereign debt is based on findings in the empirical literature. See, for example, Checherita and Rother*. The benchmark refers to the main scenario of the debt sustainability analysis simulations based on the December 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection exercise for the period 2021-24 and assumes broad minimum compliance of the fiscal path thereafter with the Stability and Growth Pact (gradual convergence to countries’ specific medium-term fiscal objectives, with current debt rule requirements not included in the simulations). In the first scenario, a permanent increase in interest rates of 100 basis points is applied to all new and refinancing operations as of 2023 across the whole yield curve over a ten-year horizon. In the second scenario, the increase in interest rates is combined with a fall in potential GDP growth by one percentage point for three years over the period 2023-2025. No catching-up effect is expected after 2025, leading to a permanent downward shift of 3% in the potential GDP level.

Expansion continues in residential real estate markets, increasing the vulnerability to corrections
Vulnerabilities in euro area residential real estate markets continued to build. Euro area house prices increased at a rate of almost 10% in the final quarter of 2021 – the fastest pace observed in the last 20 years (Chart 6, panel a). The trend was driven among other things by changes in housing preferences triggered by the pandemic, low interest rates and supply-side constraints (Box 2). At the same time, the buoyant growth of residential real estate prices is coupled with robust mortgage lending (Section 1.5). The associated rise in vulnerabilities led to the European Systemic Risk Board issuing new warnings and recommendations in December 2021, strengthening the case for macroprudential action in some countries (Chapter 5). While house price pressures are buttressed in the near term by tight supply conditions and continued demand amid household and investor preference for housing, signs of overvaluation render some housing markets prone to price corrections. In particular, an abrupt increase in real interest rates could induce house price corrections (Box 2).

Risks from mortgage indebtedness are amplified by the impact of higher costs on the debt servicing capacity of euro area households. Despite rising indebtedness since the start of the pandemic (Section 1.4), balance sheet fundamentals of euro area households remained relatively solid overall. However, higher inflation and energy price outturns may reduce households’ purchasing power, unless wages catch up sufficiently without destabilising inflation expectations. The associated squeeze may particularly affect lower-income households, which spend a larger portion of their incomes on food and energy. At the same time, the currently relatively favourable financial and employment situations of euro area households could worsen, should prolonged economic weakness translate into a growing number of corporate insolvencies and restructurings. In an environment of deteriorating income positions and higher interest rates, households’ debt servicing capacity could be challenged, particularly in countries with elevated debt levels and high debt servicing needs (Chart 6, panel b). That said, the shift towards more fixed-rate mortgage lending in recent years will shield many households from the immediate impact of higher interest rates (Chart 7, panel c). Similarly, active use of macroprudential policies in most euro area countries, notably through borrower-based measures, are helping to improve the resilience of borrowers.
Euro area banks show resilience, but profitability prospects worsen as asset quality concerns resurface
The positive market sentiment towards euro area banks in 2021 reversed sharply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Marked corrections in bank share prices (Chart 7, panel a) erased the gains made in 2021 amid improved earnings and expectations of higher interest rates. After the initial shock, markets reversed some of the losses as it became apparent that only a few banks had material direct exposures to Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the majority of banks signalled their commitment to previously announced dividend and share buyback plans for 2022.
After a remarkable recovery in bank profitability in 2021, projections for 2022 have been revised down as credit risks have increased. Bank profitability surpassed pre-pandemic levels in 2021, driven by higher operating income and lower loan loss provisions, but profitability prospects have worsened in line with a weaker macroeconomic backdrop. Profitability remained solid at the start of 2022 too, but bank analysts revised down their 2022 return on equity (ROE) forecasts for euro area banks to around 7% (Chart 7, panel a) – a level which is still low by international standards. While banks showed resilience and credit risks associated with direct exposures are limited, the banking sector could be indirectly affected by the repercussions of the war. For example, it may be exposed to greater corporate and household credit risks as a result of higher commodity prices and disrupted global supply chains. In fact, a further major energy price shock could translate into higher corporate probabilities of default (PDs), including in some sectors that were badly hit by the pandemic, such as accommodation and food services (Chart 7, panel b). However, a broader vulnerability exercise suggests that overall the banking sector is resilient to the second-round effects arising from the Russia-Ukraine war (see Box 6).
A rise in interest rates may provide some support to bank margins in the short run, but some banks might face challenges in the medium term. A higher interest rate environment and steeper yield curve will mechanically support interest income and, in turn, bank profitability, but funding low-yielding assets profitably may become challenging in the medium term. In particular, the large-scale shift over the last decade from floating to fixed-rate lending, especially for households, may dampen some of the benefits that banks enjoy from higher interest rates (Chart 7, panel c). This may pose a risk to banks’ medium-term profitability prospects in cases where such interest rate exposures are less well hedged (Box 5). As interest rates rise, banks could also face higher credit risks, given growing exposures to vulnerabilities in the non-financial sector in recent years.

Long-standing structural challenges, together with a greater need to manage cyber risk, continue to weigh on the outlook for euro area banks. Longer-term challenges associated with low cost-efficiency, limited revenue diversification and overcapacity compound growing cyclical headwinds. In addition, euro area banks urgently need to press ahead with their digital transformation, not least to be able to manage the growing threat of cyber risks. However, having focused on cost-cutting in recent years to boost profits, parts of the banking sector continue to lag behind global peers in terms of IT infrastructure investment (Chapter 3). Heightened uncertainty surrounding the outlook and lower profit expectations may now further delay the transformation plans of euro area banks, which would have an adverse impact on their competitiveness.
Financial institutions and markets need to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy
Banks and non-banks alike need to step up their efforts to support the move towards a net-zero economy. Metrics of financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related risks show little evidence of a decline over the last few years. In fact, while euro area NFCs have reduced actual emissions, loans to more polluting firms still represent around two-thirds of banks’ credit exposures (Special Feature A). Similarly, banks and non-banks have reduced their holdings of securities issued by firms with higher emission levels only slightly over the last five years (Chart 8, panel a). The Russian war in Ukraine has highlighted the risks that can arise from high dependency on fossil fuels, whose price and supply can be volatile.

ICPFs stands for insurance corporations and pension funds, IFs stands for investment funds. Panel b: combined market capitalisation refers only to firms disclosing emission-reduction targets.
While green financial markets continue to deepen, there is a need to monitor greenwashing risks. Sustainable financial markets continued to grow at a brisk pace in 2021, amid growing investor interest in green finance. Firms are increasingly disclosing their exposure to transition risk as well as their commitments to reduce emissions (Chart 8, panel b), indicating increasing awareness of the need to transition to a low-carbon economy. That said, greenwashing risks do remain in capital markets. These need to be tackled using better, more consistent information and enhanced standards for financial instruments, to ensure that green finance effectively supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Macroprudential policy needs to strengthen resilience to handle future shocks
The euro area financial stability outlook has deteriorated as inflation has risen, especially since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Upside risks to inflation, especially from energy prices, and downside risks to growth are amplifying pre-existing vulnerabilities identified in previous issues of the FSR, such as those associated with mispricing in some financial and tangible asset markets, as well as the legacy of higher debt levels in non-financial sectors. The vulnerabilities identified could be exacerbated by shocks such as (i) a further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war or further economic sanctions imposed in response to the war; (ii) unexpected changes in growth or inflation; or (iii) a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, with a greater economic impact than currently expected. The potential for these vulnerabilities to materialise simultaneously and possibly amplify each other further increases the medium-term risks to financial stability.
As economic conditions allow, further building resilience in a timely manner remains a sound policy strategy. Banks currently have ample capital headroom on top of their regulatory requirements, and a vulnerability analysis specifically assessing the adverse implications of the war in Ukraine indicates that the euro area banking system remains resilient under the scenarios considered. Nevertheless, macroprudential policy action would further enhance resilience against vulnerabilities that have already accumulated, including those in residential real estate markets, and mitigate the risk of bank de-leveraging if systemic risk materialises. As long as economic conditions do not deteriorate significantly, existing bank capital generation capacity and headroom should mitigate a detrimental impact on credit supply from increasing capital buffers. In addition, there are also costs associated with delayed action, especially if uncertainty persisted into the medium term and vulnerabilities remained unaddressed or continued to build. Overall, if the economic costs of activating additional capital buffers remain low and the financial cycle is expected to remain on an upward trend, as was the case prior to the outbreak of the war, when policy tightening commenced in some countries, authorities can continue to act appropriately while taking into account the uncertainty related to the war to avoid procyclical effects. Authorities should tailor their policy strategy to the national context by using the whole range of macroprudential instruments that are at their disposal, including borrower-based measures as already in place in several countries.
Creating additional macroprudential space while also enhancing the effectiveness of the existing countercyclical capital buffer would support the resilience of the financial system over the medium term. In its input to the European Commission’s review of the macroprudential framework, the ECB has called for more macroprudential space in the form of a higher amount of releasable capital buffers that could further improve banks’ loss absorption capacity while maintaining the provision of key services in a downturn. In addition, increasing the flexibility in the existing countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) framework could facilitate timely policy action in both the activation and release phases. The ECB’s response also included additional proposals to fill other gaps in the policy toolkit, promote the implementation of instruments at the national level, streamline the activation and coordination procedures for macroprudential measures and address global risks.
Regulatory initiatives to tackle risks from liquidity mismatches, leverage and margining practices in the non-bank financial sector should continue to progress. Developing a comprehensive macroprudential approach for non-banks remains essential to address structural vulnerabilities and strengthen the sector’s resilience. The focus of the international policy agenda has now shifted to structural liquidity mismatches in the investment fund sector and should prioritise a better alignment of asset liquidity with redemption terms. The use of leverage by non-banks in a highly interconnected global financial system is a key concern for financial stability and needs to be tackled using a range of measures across entities and activities. In addition, recent events have underlined the need to make further progress with international efforts to assess financial stability risks arising from margining practices.
1 Macro-financial and credit environment
1.1 Euro area economic outlook weakens on the back of global cost pressures and the war in Ukraine
Since the November 2021 Financial Stability Review, the economic outlook for the euro area has weakened, while inflation projections have been revised upwards. Private sector forecasters have downgraded their growth expectations significantly since the end of last year as the repercussions of the Russian war in Ukraine reverberate globally, likely slowing the economic recovery. The supply chain and cost pressures that built up during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have been amplified by the war, which has prompted further increases in commodity prices, affected supply chains and substantially weakened consumer confidence. As a result, consensus expectations for real GDP growth in the euro area in 2022 have been downgraded to 2.7% (down 1 percentage points since late February), while inflation expectations have been revised upwards to 6.8% (up 2.6 percentage points since late February) (Chart 1.1, panel a).

CEE and Russia forecasts show April 2022 consensus GDP growth expectations.
While the war in Ukraine has prompted material increases in energy and commodity prices, the more direct impact via euro area exports has been contained. Sanctions have served to significantly isolate Russia’s economy, which is reflected in a sharp downgrade of its economic growth outlook and a simultaneous increase in inflation expectations (Chart 1.1, panel b). The direct impact of the conflict on the euro area economy has been relatively modest. On aggregate, exports to Russia account for 3% of foreign demand, with some eastern European countries having significantly larger exposures (Chart 1.2, panel a). Imports from Russia, at around 4% of the total, are also modest. However, the relatively small headline figures for imports and exports conceal the euro area’s greater dependency in terms of energy supply. The euro area relies on Russian imports for 20% of its oil and 35% of its gas needs, with some larger economies showing even greater levels of dependency. Accordingly, those economies with a larger share of Russian energy in their total energy mix may face greater challenges in finding alternative sources and might be harder hit if further sanctions are imposed.

The conflict in Ukraine has added to pre-existing global inflationary pressures as the war has increased the prices of food and non-food commodities. Prices have increased strongly in those commodities of which Russia and Ukraine are major global exporters (Chart 1.2, panel b). Moreover, the sharp rise in commodity prices observed since the start of the conflict is adding to pre-existing inflationary pressures in commodities used in the extraction or processing of other commodities (e.g. steel, aluminium) and potash used to produce fertilisers and metals. Spiralling commodity prices are posing particular difficulties for importing emerging market economies. Moreover, emerging markets, such as India, Turkey, Mexico and developing CEE countries, may experience significant rises in headline figures on the back of the weighting of commodities in their consumption baskets. Added to these concerns is the prospect of global monetary tightening and associated spillovers, which could have a negative effect on debt sustainability in emerging markets (Chapter 2).
Supply chain bottlenecks continue to weigh on the global recovery and may intensify. Global supply chains have been under pressure since late 2020 on account of strong demand for manufactured goods, shortages in the supply of certain key inputs and disruptions in the logistics industry. As a result, suppliers’ delivery times in the euro area have lengthened considerably over the past year and have contributed to significantly higher input prices (Chart 1.3, panel a). Going forward, some supply chains are also likely to be affected by the war in Ukraine, given the significant role, among others, played by both Russia and Ukraine in global metal exports, among others (Chart 1.2, panel b). In addition, China’s zero-COVID policy has resulted in strict lockdowns being imposed in several economic centres, further disrupting the supply of certain goods. Moreover, although the euro area Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) remains comfortably in expansionary territory (55.8 in April 2022), disruptions continue to weigh on the business cycle, delaying the (global) recovery from the pandemic (Chart 1.3, panel b).

The slowdown in the Chinese economy is adding to the vulnerabilities in emerging markets and is increasing the downside risks to the global recovery. The turmoil in China’s property development sector continued at the start of 2022, with growth in residential real estate sales remaining negative and house prices weakening further. In addition, strict pandemic containment policies are depressing economic activity, which is forecast to grow at around 5% annually in the period 2022-24, significantly below the long-term average of 8%. A slowing Chinese economy also poses additional challenges for emerging market economies with close financial links to China. All in all, these developments add further downside risks for global economic prospects, with a potentially significant spillover to the euro area (Box 4).
The new economic challenges come at a time when some sectors and countries are still recovering from the pandemic shock. Although high vaccination levels and the less deadly Omicron variant have allowed euro area economies to largely reopen since the start of the year, economic sectors continue to be affected asymmetrically by the pandemic. For example, activity in the arts and entertainment sector still lags pre-pandemic levels, while the technology sector has clearly benefited from the consumption trends observed during the pandemic (Chart 1.4, panel a). This sectoral fragmentation is also reflected in the economic recoveries of euro area countries. Some countries have only recently recovered from the pandemic but are currently facing high inflationary pressures (Chart 1.4, panel b). Moreover, depending on their degree of trade dependency with Russia and Ukraine, some euro area countries will be hit harder by the war in Ukraine than others, exacerbating asymmetries in growth and inflation rates.

Downside risks to fiscal positions predominate as the recovery slows and governments cope with the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Before the war, it was expected that the euro area budget deficit would improve in response to lower discretionary spending on pandemic support measures, significant windfall revenues

and a lower cyclical component (Chart 1.5, panel a). However, fiscal assumptions and projections are currently surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, given the implications of the war in Ukraine. Slower economic growth than previously anticipated will have a negative impact on deficits. In addition, governments will face increases in expenditure on account of several factors including measures to mitigate the impact of higher energy prices on households, the influx of refugees from Ukraine and the higher levels of defence spending announced by some euro area governments. This could result in a slightly lower cyclically adjusted primary balance in 2022 than previously anticipated (Chart 1.5, panel b).

Notes: Panel a: the grey line depicts the 3% of GDP budget deficit threshold set in the Maastricht Treaty. The data refer to the aggregate general government sector of euro area countries. The fiscal stance is adjusted for the impact of Next Generation EU (NGEU) grants on the revenue side. The cyclical component refers to the impact of the economic cycle as well as temporary measures taken by governments, such as one-off revenues or one-off capital transfers. Panel b: the term “cyclically adjusted primary balance” is defined as the cyclically adjusted balance plus net interest payable/paid (interest expense minus interest revenue), following the IMF’s World Economic Outlook convention.
Higher than projected budget deficits and a slower economic recovery might make debt dynamics less favourable. Following the implementation of economic support measures of around 4.0% of GDP in 2020 in response to the pandemic, crisis and recovery spending is estimated to have increased to about 4.3% of GDP in 2021. Despite this sizeable fiscal support, the economic recovery and favourable financing conditions have helped to stabilise government debt-to-GDP ratios in euro area countries with higher or lower levels of debt, although debt levels continue to diverge widely between euro area countries (Chart 1.6, panel a). The projected improvement in the budget balance from 2022 onwards is expected to be driven by a higher cyclically adjusted primary balance, as many of the emergency measures not funded by NGEU grants will expire. As a result, euro area debt-to-GDP levels are projected to decline from 95.6% of GDP in 2021 to 88.7% in 2024. Going forward, however, risks to sovereign indebtedness are to the upside as governments face challenges from higher than anticipated deficits and slowing economic activity. As such, debt-to-GDP ratios might not follow the downward path currently envisaged under the baseline scenario (Overview).

Higher than expected inflation can contribute to debt servicing pressures, especially in cases of high refinancing needs and relatively large shares of inflation-indexed securities. Although debt ratios would benefit from a declining real debt burden owing to first round effects (a favourable denominator effect), higher risk premia and slower economic growth could still contribute to increasing debt ratios in the medium term, particularly for high-debt countries.

As such, additional fiscal space to cushion the economy from future economic downturns might become more limited in some euro area countries. Moreover, the level of recovery from the pandemic and inflation rates diverge widely across euro area countries, contributing to higher fragmentation risks (Section 1.1).
Financing conditions for euro area sovereigns have remained favourable overall. Although government bond yields have increased of late, financing conditions have remained relatively favourable in recent months, despite the heightened uncertainty, increasing sovereign bond yields and deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop. Moreover, although measures of sovereign stress are rising, so far this has not affected higher-debt countries more than other euro area countries (Chart 1.6, panel b). In addition, governments had extended the average residual maturity to eight years by the end of March 2022, mostly by issuing longer-term securities, increasing their resilience to rising interest rates. At the same time, debt servicing needs remain elevated, with some euro area countries facing refinancing and interest expenditure in excess of 40% of GDP over the next two years. As such, a further deterioration in financial conditions could weigh on fiscal positions going forward.
All in all, risks to sovereign debt sustainability appear to be manageable in the short run, but sovereign risks could intensify in the event of a sustained rise in credit risk premia or more subdued growth outturns. Although sovereign yields have increased of late, the economic recovery at the end of 2021 and largely favourable financing conditions have helped to stabilise debt levels in the euro area. Going forward, fiscal policy will be affected by both exposure to the war and recovery from the pandemic. Moreover, the fundamental role of economic growth dynamics in determining fiscal sustainability underlines the need for fiscal policy to be growth-friendly. The NGEU package could provide additional cushioning for the euro area economy and trigger the kind of reforms required to boost long-term growth potential. Adding to sovereign risks, some sovereigns with higher debt are also exposed to weaker banks and exhibit a less robust, more fragmentated corporate landscape, increasing risks relating to a sovereign-bank-corporate nexus (Box 1). These adverse developments could trigger a reassessment of sovereign risk by market participants and reignite pressures on more vulnerable sovereigns.
1.3 Corporates face new headwinds as supply bottlenecks persist
Following the solid recovery seen in the second half of 2021, euro area corporates are now facing increasing headwinds from rising producer prices and supply chain pressures. Measures of aggregate corporate vulnerabilities improved as the economy experienced a robust recovery in the second half of 2021, with gross profits bouncing back to 7% above pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the economic recovery and pandemic support measures have helped to keep financing conditions favourable, cushioning debt service needs and rollover risks. As a result, the composite indicator for euro area corporate vulnerabilities has remained well below its historical average (Chart 1.7, panel a). However, corporates now face new headwinds stemming from a slowing economy, higher interest rates, worsening supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy prices (Section 1.1).

Panel b: total assets are the sum of total financial and non-financial assets (liabilities) of non-financial corporations. Sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are approximated by the four-quarter moving average of gross value added and mixed income respectively, as reported in the quarterly sector accounts. Series multiplied by 100.
The sharp increase in input prices may squeeze corporate profit margins. Despite the robust recovery in corporate earnings, activity in the corporate sector remained subdued towards the end of 2021 (Chart 1.7, panels a and b). Moreover, corporate profitability partially recovered on account of higher profit margins, offsetting the more persistent loss in output since the start of the pandemic (Chart 1.7, panel b). Going forward, it might become harder for some sectors to sustain high profit margins as input prices soar in many sectors and the economy slows. Higher input prices currently translate into expectations of increased selling prices going forward, especially for sectors with high energy consumption and low inventories (Chart 1.8, panel a). At the same time, some firms have started to indicate that input prices are increasing faster than output prices, possibly resulting in margin compression. This seems to be the case for the corporates that still face challenges stemming from the pandemic and for corporates with high energy needs, such as manufacturers of metals (Chart 1.8, panel b). Historically, higher input prices are largely passed on to end users, particularly when the cost-push shock is global, although given the fact that the economic outlook has softened considerably some producers might have less pricing power going forward. Moreover, the magnitude of current price volatility could be a concern for companies with (unhedged) fixed contractual obligations, and which cannot easily adjust pricing, such as utilities and construction firms (Chapter 2).

Panel b: shown as the PMI output price index minus the producer prices PMI on sector level. A narrowing spread between output and producer prices PMIs can be interpreted as margin compression.
External financing needs have risen in response to robust economic activity, but the economic impact of the war in Ukraine might dampen credit growth going forward. Bank lending to corporates continued to increase in the first months of 2022, but moderated in March as credit standards tightened, and risk perceptions increased as a result of the war in Ukraine. During the first months of the year the demand for loans remained high on account of high working capital and fixed investment requirements. The need for higher working capital mainly reflects financing demands created by the pandemic situation, while the increase in fixed investment is driven by the economic recovery. Amid a wide range across firms and euro area countries, debt levels declined to 80% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2021 but remained above the 75% of GDP recorded before the pandemic.

The increase in net debt has been much less pronounced, reflecting elevated working capital levels and liquid holdings (Chart 1.9, panel a). Going forward, corporate financing conditions might deteriorate when economic growth slows, inflation remains elevated and both markets and banks reassess the risk surrounding corporate activity (Chapter 2). Moreover, banks anticipate a stronger net tightening of credit standards in the future, reflecting the uncertain economic impact of the war. This might be particularly concerning for firms that exited the pandemic with high debt levels, subdued earnings and lower liquidity buffers (Chart 1.9, panel b, and Box 1).

Notes: Panel a: “Liquid assets” comprises currency and deposits; “Gross debt” refers to consolidated debt securities and loans of non-financial corporations; “Net debt” is the difference between gross debt and liquid assets. The debt service ratio (DSR) is defined as the ratio of interest payments plus amortisations to income. As such, the DSR provides a flow-to-flow comparison – the flow of debt service payments divided by the flow of income; see “How much income is used for debt payments? A new database for debt service ratios”, BIS Quarterly Review, September 2015. Panel b: earnings per share reflect Bloomberg consensus estimates for the sector level sub-indices of the STOXX EUROPE index. The total debt and current ratio are sub-index averages. The current ratio reflects the ratio of current assets to current liabilities and measures a firm’s ability to settle short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.
Insolvencies, which would normally be expected to rise as economic growth softens, have remained well below their pre-pandemic levels. Policy support measures have successfully mitigated solvency risks which, together with robust economic growth, kept insolvencies 20% below their pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2022. Moreover, forward-looking measures for defaults remain subdued (Chart 1.9, panel c). At the same time, firms whose balance sheets weakened by the pandemic now face fresh challenges from strong input price inflation, softening economic growth and rising interest rates. Furthermore, results from the latest ECB bank lending survey show banks indicating that they are concerned that supply chain disruptions, high energy and other input prices, and corporate exposures to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus might amplify firms’ credit risks. As such, insolvencies could rise in the sectors most affected by supply chain disruptions and by an economic recovery that has proved fragile since the pandemic.
Overall, firms weakened by the pandemic now face additional challenges from intensifying cost pressures as the economic recovery slows. Some countries and sectors have experienced an increase in net debt levels since the start of the pandemic. Moreover, some corporates will also face significant debt servicing needs over the coming years (Chart 1.9, panel a). Although public guarantee schemes have helped corporates to attract longer-term funding during the pandemic and corporates have built significant cash buffers, a possible further rise in interest rates might impact non-financial corporations that borrow at variable rates. In addition, some firms have been less able to profit from the economic recovery over recent quarters as their business models have continued to be affected by pandemic containment measures. Some of these corporations also have higher debt, lower liquidity and lower sales levels and might face challenges when the economy slows or if they cannot pass on increases in input prices to end users in full (Box 1). Adding further to these vulnerabilities, weaker corporates are also concentrated in countries with greater sovereign and bank vulnerabilities.
Box 1
Identifying the corporates most vulnerable to price shocks following the pandemic
Prepared by Julian Metzler, Benjamin Mosk, Nander de Vette and Peter Welz
By the end of 2021, the aggregate profitability and debt positions of euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs) had recovered to pre-pandemic levels. While overall gross debt relative to gross value added remains elevated at around 160%, net debt has returned to its pre-pandemic level of around 100% of gross value added, with firms having increased precautionary cash buffers amid favourable financing conditions. However, these aggregate developments were mostly driven by large firms, while the net debt positions of small firms increased as they used credit to offset those cash flow losses that were not covered by government support measures. In addition, many corporates now face broad-based increases in input prices on the back of energy price rises and supply chain disruptions. Against this backdrop, this box uses firm-level balance sheet data for around 91,000 euro area non-financial corporations to identify vulnerable firms based on the Altman Z-score, a measure of insolvency risk that uses five balance sheet and income statement ratios and their joint importance.

1.4 Households face rising inflation and greater uncertainty
While the aggregate financial position of euro area households has remained stable, downside risks have increased in the light of higher inflation and the war in Ukraine. Throughout the second half of 2021, households benefited from the economic recovery, low unemployment and favourable financing conditions. The debt-to-disposable income ratio stabilised at 98%, as nominal income growth remained solid and debt servicing costs reached record lows (Chart 1.10, panel a). Supported by valuation gains in financial investments and house prices, households’ net worth surged to 785% of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 26 percentage points on a year earlier, but remains unevenly distributed across households. At the same time, however, consumer sentiment became clouded by the pick-up in consumer prices and, when energy and food prices rose further following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, plunged back towards the low levels observed after the pandemic first broke out in Europe (Chart 1.10, panel b). In a tail risk scenario, the war may also indirectly affect households via labour markets, where conditions could deteriorate if a large number of firms fail to withstand the adverse effects of higher input prices and supply chain disruptions reinforced by sanctions on Russia.

Household debt levels remain contained, but rising inflation and the war in Ukraine have prompted a sharp deterioration in sentiment

Notes: Panel a: debt is defined as total loans granted to households by all institutional sectors. Gross interest payments are measured before allocation of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM). Panel b: HICP stands for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices measure of inflation.
Inflation weighs on real household incomes and may have a disproportionate effect on both lower-income households and those with weaker debt servicing capacity. Nominal income growth returned to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, due to increases in consumer prices driven predominantly by energy and food items, real incomes shrunk in the same period (Chart 1.11, panel a). Many households may be able to temporarily cushion the impact of higher prices by scaling back saving or drawing on excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. But these savings are likely concentrated in higher-income households, whereas lower-income households are more exposed to the inflation shock as they spend a relatively larger share of their income on energy and food-related items (Chart 1.11, panel b). Accordingly, a share of households has to rely on fiscal relief measures or cut down on non-essential consumption. In general, some households may benefit from higher than expected inflation in the sense that it lowers the real cost of pre-existing debt, but it is unlikely that these households are sufficiently compensated for the rise in inflation through higher nominal income.

Overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened slightly from December 2021 to February 2022, mostly ahead of Russia-Ukraine conflict
Market participants reported mixed results for financing conditions in securities financing markets, along with slightly deteriorating credit conditions and liquidity in OTC derivatives markets
Longer term, market participants reported tighter overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions
The responses contained in the March 2022 summary mainly cover the period preceding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, they only reflect the impact of this geopolitical development to a limited degree.
Overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened slightly over the period from December 2021 to February 2022. While price terms became tighter across the board, non-price terms were more restrictive for non-financial corporations only. This tightening continues the trend reported in the previous three quarters and is broadly in line with expectations expressed in the previous survey. Looking ahead, respondents to the March survey expected a further tightening of price and non-price terms for all types of counterparty over the period from March to May 2022.
Turning to securities financing transactions, survey responses for financing conditions were mixed. This was reflected in net percentages of participants reporting a slightly higher maximum amount and maximum maturity of funding for most types of euro-denominated collateral, and in slightly increasing rates/spreads for funding against most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral had increased slightly or were unchanged for all types of collateral. Respondents reported stronger demand for funding against government bonds, but weaker demand for funding against most other collateral types.
As for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, respondents reported that initial margin requirements had increased slightly for many types of OTC derivative, and that liquidity and trading had deteriorated for many OTC derivative types over the December 2021 to February 2022 review period.
Specific questions included in the March 2022 survey looked into the longer-term trend by asking respondents to compare credit terms and conditions observed in early March 2022 with those reported in the previous year (i.e. in early March 2021). Compared with the previous year, overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had tightened across all counterparties. In net terms, credit standards for secured funding had also tightened. Survey respondents reported that non-price conditions in OTC derivatives markets were unchanged for all types of derivative relative to the previous year.
The March 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the ECB’s website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The March 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between December 2021 and February 2022. The results are based on responses from a panel of 27 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 13 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

During the meeting participants discussed the economic impact of the war on Ukraine. General Council members expressed their full support for the people of Ukraine: “Today’s meeting is a strong sign of European unity in the face of the war against Ukraine”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
National Central Banks of the ESCB decided to offer traineeship opportunities for Ukrainian citizens. For its part, the ECB will support young Ukrainians in acquiring professional experience in a European institution by providing 15 traineeships to cover its organisational needs.
The ECB is looking for recent graduates and young professionals to join the ECB for maximum of 12 months. Traineeships provide an opportunity to both put into practice knowledge acquired while studying and gain a better understanding of what working for Europe entails. The relevant vacancy notice will be published on the ECB’s website in the coming weeks, and the selection process will follow the ECB’s usual recruitment procedure. Successful applicants will join business areas based on their profiles and the ECB’s business needs.

Size of repo line remains unchanged at €4.5 billion
ECB has extended several liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks until 15 January 2023
Extensions address increased uncertainty and regional spillover risks owing to war in Ukraine
The European Central Bank (ECB) and Banca Na?ional? a României (BNR) have agreed to renew the repo line arrangement to provide euro liquidity to the BNR. The arrangement will now expire on 15 January 2023. A previous repo line that had been established in 2020 expired on 31 March 2022.
Under the repo line arrangement, the ECB provides up to €4.5 billion of euro liquidity to the BNR in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral.
The continuation of the repo line with the BNR follows the ECB’s decision in March 2022 to extend the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and several bilateral liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks until 15 January 2023. In the context of heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the liquidity lines aim to prevent spillback effects on euro area financial markets and economies that might adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy.

Forecasters cite war in Ukraine as main factor behind macroeconomic forecast revisions
HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2022 and 2023 but unchanged for 2024 at 1.9%
Longer term inflation expectations revised up from 2.0% to 2.1%
Real GDP growth expectations on balance revised down
Unemployment rate expectations revised down again for all horizons
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2022, respondents revised their inflation expectations for 2022 and 2023 upward, to 6.0% and 2.4% respectively. Expectations for 2024 were unrevised at 1.9%. Regarding the near-term outlook, respondents viewed high inflation as being primarily determined by “cost-push” rather than “demand-pull” factors, and considered that the conflict in Ukraine had re-ignited and amplified price pressures that had started to show signs of peaking. Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 stood at 2.1%, revised up from 2.0% in the previous survey.
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents’ expectations were revised down for 2022 and 2023 and slightly up for 2024, but remained for all years above longer-term growth expectations which edged down marginally to 1.4%. The profile of expected quarter-on-quarter growth in 2022 was revised down in particular for the second quarter (from 1.0% to 0.5%) but while about 25% of respondents who provided a forecast quarterly growth profile saw at least one quarter of negative growth in 2022, only 4% forecasted a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth).
Notwithstanding the downward revision to expected GDP growth, unemployment rate expectations were revised down further, by between 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points for all horizons. Respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 6.9% in 2022 to 6.6% by 2026. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level for 15 years."
,"HICP inflation expectations were revised up by 3.0 percentage points for 2022 and 0.6 percentage points for 2023 but unchanged for 2024, standing at 6.0%, 2.4% and 1.9% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.

The upward revision for 2022 mainly reflects higher expected energy and food price inflation. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2026) were revised upward by another 0.1 percentage point to stand on average at 2.1%. Expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised up, particularly for 2022 and 2023. According to respondents, these revisions mainly reflect indirect effects from higher energy and food prices and effects from supply chain disruptions. GDP growth expectations were revised down for 2022 and 2023 and slightly up for 2024, to stand at 2.9%, 2.3% and 1.8% respectively and thus clearly above the longer-term growth expectations of 1.4% which were revised down marginally. At the same time, the profile of the expected unemployment rate has been revised down for all horizons by between 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points with 6.6% in 2026 being the lowest expected rate since 2007. Overall, respondents indicated that the war in Ukraine and its effects were the primary factors behind the revisions to their inflation and growth forecasts in 2022 and 2023. Indicators of the uncertainty surrounding expectations for the main macroeconomic variables remained elevated, with respondents indicating that the war in Ukraine was a new factor which overshadowed a more benign pandemic situation.

In addition to the direct impact on consumer prices for energy and food, respondents also noted that indirect effects working through the production chain as well as the adverse effects on supply chains were behind the higher forecasts for HICP inflation excluding food and energy (see below). High inflation was generally viewed as being primarily determined by “cost-push” rather than “demand-pull” factors and considered that the war in Ukraine had reignited and amplified price pressures that had started to show signs of peaking. Respondents indicated that they consider that these effects would diminish, as, notwithstanding the large upward revision to the annual average inflation rate forecast for 2022 and 2023, respondents expect a substantial decline in inflation to 1.9% in 2024. Their one-year ahead forecast for inflation in March 2023 is 2.8% – considerably lower than the latest available inflation data (7.5% HICP flash estimate for March 2022) and 1.9% for March 2024. The expected decline in inflation is attributed primarily to the view that energy and food commodity prices are expected to plateau in 2022 and to at least partially reverse thereafter.
For the shorter and medium-term horizons, quantitative indicators of uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook remained elevated and those for the balance of risks were on the upside.
[

]
Quantitative indicators of uncertainty for inflation derived from the reported probability distributions remained at historically high levels. The high level of “aggregate uncertainty” owes to a combination of elevated “disagreement” across forecasters about their point forecasts as well as a high average level of “individual uncertainty”. The aggregate probability distributions for the calendar years from 2022 to 2024 are presented in Chart 2. The quantitative balance of risk indicator (calculated as the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution minus the average reported point expectation) for shorter horizons was generally to the upside. In their qualitative remarks, respondents reported elevated uncertainties for the short-term inflation outlook related in particular to the duration of the war in Ukraine as well as to possible disruption of energy flows. Considering more medium-term risks, potential second-round effects of inflation on wages was cited as an upward risk factor.
SPF expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised up, particularly for 2022 and 2023. HICPX expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024 stood at 2.9%, 2.3% and 2.0% respectively, representing upward revisions of 0.9 percentage points for 2022, 0.5 percentage points for 2023 and 0.1 percentage points for 2024. Respondents indicated that the upward revisions reflect a higher starting point as well as indirect effects from higher energy and food prices and effects from supply chain disruptions. HICPX inflation is still expected to ease back toward 2.0% by 2024. The SPF forecasts for HICPX were higher than those from the March 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for 2022, 2023 and 2024, by 0.3, 0.5 and 0.1 percentage points respectively (see Table 1).
Chart 2
Aggregate probability distributions for expected inflation in 2022, 2023 and 2024
(x-axis: HICP inflation expectations, annual percentage changes; y-axis: probability, percentages)
Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in 2022, 2023 and 2024. To minimise changes to the questionnaire, the upper bin for inflation outcomes was not changed. The fact that this would lead to most probability being assigned to the upper bin for 2022 was flagged to respondents when sending out the questionnaire. Expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the Q4 2021 round.
2 Longer-term inflation expectations revised up further
Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2026) averaged 2.1%, a further upward revision from 2.0% in the previous round. The median point expectation increased to 2.0% from 1.9% in the previous round. The estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution also increased to 2.0% from 1.9% (see Chart 3). Having remained in a narrow range (1.64-1.69%) in the SPF rounds between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021, longer-term inflation expectations have moved up noticeably since the third quarter of 2021. In the most recent round (second quarter of 2022), considering a balanced panel of those who also replied in the first quarter of 2022 round, many more respondents revised their longer-term inflation expectations upward than downward.
[

]
In recent rounds, the distribution of individual point forecasts has changed considerably when compared with rounds from 2019 to 2021 (see Chart 4). The mode of the distribution was clearly at 2.0% and the general shape was relatively similar to that which prevailed over the period from the third quarter of 2003 (after the 2003 monetary policy strategy review) to the first quarter of 2014.

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the spread of point forecast responses.
Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations eased somewhat, while the balance of risks became much less negative. However, the decrease in the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution (see Chart 5) owed primarily to decreased disagreement while individual uncertainty as measured by the average width of the individual probability distributions increased to a historically high level. The balance of risk indicator, while remaining to the downside, moved the closest to balanced observed since 2009. The probability associated with longer-term inflation being in the range 1.5-2.5% decreased slightly to 49% (from 52%). There was some shift in the probability associated with longer-term inflation being below 1.5%, (from 28% to 22%), to outcomes above 2.5% (from 20% to 29%).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in the longer term.
The longer-term expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) remained at 1.9%. This unchanged figure conceals some upward movement at the second decimal place. Of the 28 respondents who provided longer-term HICPX expectations in both the second quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2022 rounds, 15 revised them up, 11 were unchanged and two revised them down. The median longer-term point expectation for HICPX increased to 1.9% from 1.8%. The evolution of longer-term expectations for HICP and HICPX inflation has been broadly similar for the period of available data since the fourth quarter of 2016; and the level difference of around 0.1 percentage point on average has remained broadly unchanged also in the second quarter of 2022 round.
3 Real GDP growth expectations were on balance revised down
GDP growth expectations in the Q2 2022 survey round stood at 2.9% for 2022, at 2.3% for 2023 and at 1.8% for 2024 (see Chart 6). These imply downward revisions compared with the previous round of 1.3 percentage points for 2022 and 0.4 percentage points for 2023, but a small upward revision of 0.1 percentage points for 2024. Almost all respondents attributed their downward revisions to the repercussions of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Aside from higher energy and food commodity prices, disruptions in some sectors and the sanctions imposed, they noted that the situation had resulted in falls in business and consumer confidence and loss of purchasing power for households. The new partial lockdowns in China (in response to coronavirus outbreaks there) were also mentioned as a factor contributing to prolonged supply chain disruptions and an additional economic headwind. Respondents decidedly pointed to downside risks to growth from economic sectors most affected by increased energy prices, such as manufacturing, which could be long-lasting. Going forward, risks are seen on the downside, particularly if the war’s duration is longer than assumed as well as with respect to the development of energy prices and supply bottlenecks. Upward risks mentioned were a quick resolution of the war as well as possible mitigation of the worst effects of high energy prices from fiscal interventions. Longer-term growth expectations (which refer to 2026) were marginally (by 0.1 percentage point) lower at 1.4%.
Chart 6
Expectations for real GDP growth
(annual percentage changes)
Respondents revised down the profile of their short-term GDP outlook in particular for the second quarter of 2022.
[

]
Actual quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 0.3%, similar to the forecast of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2022 round.
[
5
]
In this round, forecasters expected quarter-on-quarter growth in the first quarter of 2022 to remain modest at 0.2% and to increase only slightly to 0.4% in the second quarter of 2022 (previously they expected an increase from 0.5% to 1.0%). Growth is then expected to move further up in 20022 Q3 and 2022 Q4, at 0.7% and 0.6% respectively (see Chart 7). Although one quarter of the forecasters who provided a forecast quarterly growth profile see at least one quarter of negative growth between the first and fourth quarters of 2022, only 4% forecast a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth). Compared with the March 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, respondents were on average of the same opinion for the first quarter of 2022, and more pessimistic for the rest of 2022.

(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes)
Notes: Grey area indicates one standard deviation (of individual expectations) around average SPF expectation.
Although real GDP returned to above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2021, the downward revisions to expected growth in 2022 and 2023 have delayed its expected return to the pre-pandemic profile – see Chart 8. Expected GDP levels are also lower (by 1.0-1.5 percentage points) than forecast in the March 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
Chart 8
Forecast profile of real GDP level
(2019 = 100)
Note: Growth expectations for years not surveyed have been interpolated linearly.
Quantitative measures of uncertainty eased this round, but the medium-term balance of risk indicator turned negative (see Chart 9 and Chart 10). Aggregate uncertainty decreased at the two-years ahead and longer-term horizons. Overall, uncertainty was still elevated by historical standards but considerably lower than at its peak in the second and third quarters of 2020. Many of the risk factors identified in the qualitative comments were also factors mentioned when explaining the changes to the baseline forecasts. On the downside this was overwhelmingly related to the war in Ukraine, even higher food and commodity prices and further sanctions. Generally, with a prominent role of the war in Ukraine, in this round the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was considered a less pertinent factor behind uncertainty and risk assessments.

4 Unemployment rate expectations revised down again over all horizons
The average point forecasts for the unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2022 round were 6.9%, 6.8% and 6.7% for 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The expectation for 2026 was 6.6%, the lowest rate recorded for long-term unemployment expectations since the fourth quarter of 2007. The expected downward sloping trajectory of the unemployment rate remains (as in the previous round), but, starting from a lower level in 2022, is somewhat flatter (see Chart 11). Notwithstanding the downward revisions to GDP growth forecasts, respondents have revised down their unemployment rate forecasts by between 0.1-0.3 percentage points depending on the horizon. Respondents reported that downward revisions for 2022 are due to the data indicating a better-than-expected strength of the labour market.
Chart 11
Expectations for the unemployment rate
(percentages of the labour force)
Uncertainty surrounding expectations for the unemployment rate decreased further for all horizons, however it still stands at relatively elevated levels, while overall risks were to the upside for all horizons. On balance, the probability distributions are showing marginally (positive) skewness toward higher unemployment rate outcomes mostly for shorter but also for longer horizons (see Chart 12 and Chart 13). The balance of risk indicator for longer-term expectations remained positive as the mean of the aggregated probability distribution (at 6.7%) was slightly higher than the average point forecast (6.6%). The biggest and most frequently mentioned risk being the scenario of lower growth, with the subsequent loss of confidence and hiring from the business sector. Higher inflation (reducing real disposable incomes and consumption as well as feeding into wages) and the possibility of large inflows of immigration due to the war in Ukraine are the other most frequently mentioned factors that could give rise to more adverse unemployment rate outcomes.

5 Expectations for other variables
Forecasters expected: the ECB’s key main refinancing operations (MRO) interest rate to remain largely unchanged until the fourth quarter of 2022 with a clearer and broad-based consensus for an increase in 2023; the euro to be largely stable against the dollar in a range between 1.10 and 1.12 until 2023; oil prices to decrease steadily to levels around USD 89 per barrel until 2023; and nominal wage growth to increase at a rate higher than 3% until 2023 and decrease in the longer-term.
The median (and majority) expectation was for the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to remain at 0% until the third quarter of 2022, even though 23% (11 out of 47) of respondents expect marginal increases already in the third quarter. Interest rates are expected to stand at an average level of 0.60% (up from 0.11%) in 2023 and reach 1.0% (up from 0.33%) by 2024 (see Chart 14a). Overall, consensus for an interest rate lift-off became stronger with about half of forecasters reporting a positive interest rate in the fourth quarter of 2022, 87% in the first quarter of 2023 and more than 95% in 2023.
The expected average USD/EUR exchange rate was revised downward over all horizons and is expected to stand on average at around 1.10 in 2022, to then slightly increase at a constant pace up to 1.15 by 2024 (see Chart 14b).
Compared with the previous round, the level of US dollar-denominated oil prices (per barrel) was heavily revised upwards. The revisions were about USD 31 and USD 21 per barrel for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Compared to the previous SPF round, oil price expectations follow a steeper downward trajectory from about USD 111 per barrel in the second quarter of 2022 to around USD 89 per barrel in 2024 (see Chart 14c). Given the expected USD/EUR exchange rate, the implied revisions to the profile for the oil price in euro terms are similar to those in US dollar terms – EUR 29.8 in 2022 and EUR 20.1 in 2023.
Expectations for the annual growth in compensation per employee were revised up by 0.7 percentage points for 2022 and by 0.5 percentage points for 2023 with respect to the previous round, while remaining roughly the same in 2024 (see Chart 14d). Although revised down by 0.1 percentage points, long-term expectations stand at 2.4% thereby remaining still above the average expected growth rate for that horizon of about 2.2% recorded between 2012 and 2019.

14 April 2022,"14 April 2022
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine is causing enormous suffering. It is also affecting the economy, in Europe and beyond. The conflict and the associated uncertainty are weighing heavily on the confidence of businesses and consumers. Trade disruptions are leading to new shortages of materials and inputs. Surging energy and commodity prices are reducing demand and holding back production. How the economy develops will crucially depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of current sanctions and on possible further measures. At the same time, economic activity is still being supported by the reopening of the economy after the crisis phase of the pandemic. Inflation has increased significantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energy costs. Inflation pressures have intensified across many sectors.
At today’s meeting the Governing Council judged that the incoming data since its last meeting reinforce its expectation that net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme should be concluded in the third quarter. Looking ahead, the ECB’s monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and the Governing Council’s evolving assessment of the outlook. In the current conditions of high uncertainty, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. The Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to contribute to safeguarding financial stability.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June. At today’s meeting the Governing Council judged that the incoming data since its last meeting reinforce its expectation that net asset purchases under the APP should be concluded in the third quarter. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect the Governing Council’s evolving assessment of the outlook.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of the Governing Council’s net purchases under the APP and will be gradual. The path for the key ECB interest rates will continue to be determined by the Governing Council’s forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."
12 April 2022,"12 April 2022
Credit standards tightened for firms owing to perceptions of increased risk, with further tightening expected
Loan demand from firms continued to increase, driven mainly by working capital needs
ECB’s monetary policy seen to continue to support lending, but less so than in previous survey rounds
According to the April 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened (net percentage of banks standing at 6%, see Chart 1) in the first quarter of 2022. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a slight net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 2%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households continued to ease (net percentage of -5%). Banks referred to perceptions of increased risk and decreased risk tolerance, in the context of high uncertainty, supply chain disruptions and high energy and input prices, as factors behind the net tightening of credit standards for firms. For the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a considerably stronger net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms, likely reflecting the uncertain economic impact of the war in Ukraine and the anticipation of less accommodative monetary policy. In addition, banks expect a moderate net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened moderately for loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase in the first quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, this was mainly due to a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans, while margins on average loans widened less. For consumer credit and other lending to households, overall terms and conditions eased slightly on account of narrower loan margins.
Banks reported, on balance, a continued increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the first quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Loan demand was driven by a strong positive impact of financing needs of firms for working capital, reflecting supply chain disruptions as well as precautionary inventories and liquidity holdings. Fixed investment continued to have a positive impact on loan demand, but less than in the previous quarter. In addition, the low general level of interest rates as well as other financing needs, including mergers and acquisitions activity and debt refinancing and restructuring, contributed positively to loan demand from firms. Demand for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households increased further in net terms in the first quarter of 2022. The net increase in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates. Demand for consumer credit was supported by spending on durable consumption goods and – to a lesser extent – by consumer confidence. For the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a continued net increase in firms’ loan demand, but a net decrease in the demand for housing loans and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to wholesale funding deteriorated in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting tighter financial market conditions for banks. Banks reported that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes and the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) continued to have a positive impact on their liquidity position and market financing conditions. They expect this impact to become smaller in the case of TLTROs and negative for the ECB’s asset purchase programmes over the next six months. Banks also indicated that the ECB’s asset purchases programmes and the negative deposit facility rate (DFR) had a negative impact on their profitability, mainly via net interest income. This effect was mitigated by the ECB’s two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings and by TLTRO III. The ECB’s asset purchases, the negative DFR and TLTRO III had a continued net easing impact on lending conditions and a positive impact on lending volumes, but generally less than previously reported. Banks expect the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes to turn into a net tightening for lending conditions and a mostly negative impact for loan volumes over the next six months. For the negative DFR and TLTRO III, the net easing impact on bank lending conditions and the positive impact on lending volumes are generally expected to become weaker.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the April 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the first quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the second quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The April 2022 survey round was conducted between 7 March and 22 March 2022. A total of 151 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

A number of ad hoc questions were included in the April 2022 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes (APP and PEPP), the impact of the ECB’s negative deposit facility rate and the ECB’s two-tier system, and the impact of TLTRO III on banks and their lending policies.
1 Overview of results
In the April 2022 BLS, euro area banks indicated a net tightening of credit standards on loans to enterprises in the first quarter of 2022. That is, the percentage share of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was larger than the share of banks reporting an easing. Banks referred to perceptions of increased risk and decreased risk tolerance, in the context of high uncertainty, supply chain disruptions and high energy and input prices, as factors behind the net tightening of credit standards. For the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a considerably stronger net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, likely reflecting the uncertain economic impact of the war in Ukraine and the anticipation of less accommodative monetary policy.
Banks indicated a continued net increase in loan demand from firms in the first quarter of 2022. Financing needs of firms for working capital had a strong positive impact on loan demand, reflecting higher working capital needs due to supply bottlenecks and increasing input costs as well as precautionary inventories and liquidity holdings. Fixed investment provided a positive contribution to loan demand, albeit more moderate than in the previous quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a continued net increase in demand for loans to firms, driven by short-term loans.
Regarding credit standards for loans to households, banks reported a slight net tightening for housing loans in the first quarter of 2022 and a net easing for consumer credit. For housing loans, perceptions of higher risk and lower risk tolerance contributed to the net tightening, while the net easing for consumer credit was driven by increased risk tolerance on the part of banks. Loan demand from households increased, on balance, across loan categories in the first quarter of 2022. Housing loan demand was mainly supported by the low general level of interest rates, while durable goods consumption particularly contributed to the net increase in consumer credit demand. In the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a moderate net tightening of credit standards for all lending to households. In addition, banks expect a net decrease in housing loan demand and unchanged demand for consumer credit.
In more detail, euro area banks reported a net tightening of credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 6%, after 2% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Section 2) and expect a considerably stronger net tightening for the second quarter (21%). Banks referred to high uncertainty and a tightening impact from the general economic and firm-specific outlook on credit standards on loans to firms in the first quarter of 2022, following their overall benign view of firms’ credit risks in the fourth quarter of 2021. Banks are concerned about the impact of supply chain disruptions, high energy prices and other input costs, as well as corporate exposures to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus on firms’ credit risks. In this context, banks’ risk tolerance also declined moderately leading to a tightening impact on credit standards. The overall impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation on their credit standards remained broadly neutral. This reflects on the one hand a small tightening contribution from banks’ funding costs, likely related to the rise in bank bond yields in the context of higher than expected inflation and expectations of less accommodative monetary policy, and on the other hand an easing contribution from banks’ liquidity position related to the still accommodative monetary policy.
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a considerably stronger net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms (21%), against the background of the high uncertainty regarding the impact of the war in Ukraine on the economic outlook and firms’ credit risks. The anticipation of tighter monetary policy in the future is also likely to have played a role, as suggested by banks’ expectations regarding the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes over the coming months (see Section 3). Compared with previous episodes, the expected net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms was similar to that observed in the July 2020 survey, at the height of the pandemic credit risk concerns, and before that in the January 2012 survey, as the euro area sovereign debt crisis intensified.
In the first quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a slight net tightening of credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of banks of 2%, after 0% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Section 3), and a continued net easing for consumer credit and other lending to households (-5%, after -4%), in line with expectations reported in the previous survey round. The net tightening for housing loans was driven by higher risk perceptions and slightly lower risk tolerance, while competition and cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a broadly neutral impact. For consumer credit, increased risk tolerance mainly contributed to the net easing. Banks expect credit standards to tighten moderately for housing loans (8%) and for consumer credit (7%) in the second quarter of 2022.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened somewhat in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 3%, after 0%). This was mainly on account of a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans (net percentage of 12%; margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates), while margins on average loans widened moderately (net percentage of 4%). Banks reported a moderate net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans (net percentage of 6%, after -1%). Overall terms and conditions for consumer credit and other lending to households eased slightly in net terms (-2%, after -1%), on account of narrower loan margins.
In the first quarter of 2022, banks reported, on balance, an increase in the share of rejected applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 4%, after 0%). For housing loans, euro area banks reported broadly no change in the share of rejected applications (1%, after 2%), while the share of rejected applications decreased slightly in net terms for consumer credit (-2%, after -3%).
Among the largest euro area countries, credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in Germany, Spain and Italy, while these remained unchanged in France in the first quarter of 2022 (see Overview table). Credit standards for housing loans tightened in Germany, eased in Italy and remained unchanged in France and Spain. Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households eased in France and Italy and remained unchanged in Germany and Spain.
Firms’ net demand for loans continued to increase in the first quarter of 2022, according to banks (net percentage of 17%, after 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Section 2). Loan demand continued to be driven by a strong positive impact of firms’ financing needs for working capital (net percentage of 16%) reflecting supply chain disruptions, as well as precautionary inventories and liquidity holdings in an environment of high uncertainty. The contribution of fixed investment to loan demand remained positive (net percentage of 9%) but moderated following the significant positive contribution in the previous quarter. Loan demand increased, in net terms, for long-term maturities – reflecting the continued economic recovery at the beginning of the year and expected increases in financing costs – and, to a smaller extent, for short-term maturities related to supply chain disruptions and the impact of the war. In addition, banks continued to report a positive impact on loan demand from the low general level of interest rates as well as other financing needs, which include mergers and acquisitions activity and debt refinancing and restructuring. In the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a continued net increase in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of 12%), due to stronger demand for short-term loans, while banks expect demand for long-term loans to decrease slightly in net terms.
In the first quarter of 2022, net loan demand from households increased further, both for housing loans (net percentage of 10%, after 8% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Section 2) and for consumer credit (net percentage of 11%, after 2%). The net increase in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates, in line with a narrowing of margins on average loans and possibly reflecting anticipation effects of the expected further increases in interest rates as bank funding costs rise. The positive net contribution of housing market prospects to loan demand decreased further compared with previous quarters. Demand for consumer credit was supported by durable consumption and – to a lesser extent – by consumer confidence in the first quarter, despite the sharp decline in consumer confidence recorded by the European Commission’s sentiment indicator in March 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a net decrease in the demand for housing loans (-10%) and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit (1%).
Banks reported a net increase in demand for loans to enterprises in Germany and France, while it remained unchanged according to banks in Spain and decreased in Italy in the first quarter of 2022 (see Overview table). Net demand for housing loans increased in Germany and Spain, remained unchanged in France and decreased in Italy. Demand for consumer credit increased in all four largest euro area countries.

Latest BLS results for the largest euro area countries
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards or an increase in loan demand)
Notes: The “Avg.” columns contain historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.
The April 2022 BLS also included a number of ad hoc questions. Regarding access to retail and wholesale funding, euro area banks reported that their access to money markets, securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions for banks. By contrast, access to retail funding remained broadly unchanged in the first quarter of 2022. In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a further deterioration of their access to market-based funding.
The ECB’s asset purchase programmes continued to have a positive net impact on banks’ liquidity position and market financing conditions over the past six months, but banks expect this to turn into a negative impact over the next six months. The expected deterioration is likely related to the envisaged scaling down of monetary policy accommodation, specifically the end of net asset purchases under the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March 2022 and the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases under the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP) over the next six months. Likewise, banks expect the net easing impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on their credit standards and terms and conditions, which they reported mainly for loans to enterprises over the past six months, to turn into a limited net tightening impact over the coming six months. For lending volumes, the continued, albeit smaller, positive impact of the ECB’s net asset purchases on lending volumes to firms and households for house purchase over the past six months is expected to turn into a limited dampening impact over the coming six months for lending to firms. For lending to households, banks report a broadly neutral impact of the expected gradual normalisation of monetary policy accommodation.
Euro area banks reported, in net terms, that the ECB’s negative deposit facility rate (DFR) continued to contribute negatively to their profitability over the past six months. The DFR, on balance, reduced lending rates and had a positive impact on lending volumes for loans to firms and households. In addition, the DFR had a negative impact on deposit rates and a positive impact on non-interest rate charges on deposits from firms and households, indicating a continued pass-through of negative rates. Over the next six months, banks expect the impact of the DFR on lending and deposits to continue in the same direction but to become weaker. The two-tier system reportedly mitigated the negative impact of the DFR on bank profitability compared with a counterfactual situation without such a system, mainly via a positive impact on net interest income, while banks did not report any further impact on lending rates and deposit rates for firms and households.
Banks’ participation in the last operation of the TLTRO III programme in December 2021 was more limited compared with previous operations, in line with lower overall take-up of TLTRO III funds. Granting loans to the non-financial private sector remained the most common use of funds over the past six months, while profitability remained the most important reason for banks to participate in TLTRO III. In addition, a considerable fraction of banks reported holding TLTRO III liquidity with the Eurosystem. According to banks, TLTRO III continued to have a positive impact on their financial situation and lending volumes as well as a net easing impact on lending conditions for firms and households, implying a sustained positive impact of the large outstanding TLTRO liquidity despite the lower take-up in recent operations. Over the next six months, banks expect a further but more limited positive impact on their financial situation and lending volumes from TLTRO III and a more limited net easing impact on terms and conditions.

General notes
The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 151 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.

BLS questionnaire
The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e. domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat or (5) eased/increased considerably.
In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).
Aggregation of banks’ replies to national and euro area BLS results
The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.
In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.
[
3
]
For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.
In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares of lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.
BLS indicators
Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e. they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.
[
4
]
The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.
A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).
Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e. an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.
In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.
In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.
Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via the Statistical Data Warehouse.
A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on the ECB's website.
2 Developments in credit standards, terms and conditions, and net demand for loans in the euro area
2.1 Loans to enterprises
2.1.1 Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened
Euro area banks reported a net tightening of credit standards (i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the first quarter of 2022, i.e. the percentage share of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards was larger than the share of banks reporting an easing (net percentage of banks of 6%, after 2% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Chart 1 and Overview table). While the net tightening remained slightly below the historical average (8%; see Overview table), banks had expected broadly unchanged credit standards in the previous quarter (-1%), as they were optimistic about the economic recovery from the pandemic. In the first quarter of 2022, credit standards tightened equally for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs; 7%, after 2%) and large firms (7%, after -2%; see Chart 2). They tightened for both short-term loans (5%, after 0%) and for long-term loans (6%, after 0%).
Banks indicated a net tightening impact of increased risk perceptions and decreased risk tolerance in the first quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1 and Table 1). They referred to a tightening impact from the general economic and firm-specific outlook as well as from the war in Ukraine and the related uncertainty.
[

]
This follows their overall benign view of firms’ credit risks in the fourth quarter of 2021. Banks are concerned about the impact of supply chain disruptions, high energy and other input prices as well as corporate exposures to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus on firms’ credit risks. The overall impact of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation on their credit standards remained broadly neutral. This reflects on the one hand a small tightening contribution from banks’ funding costs due to the rise in bank bond yields in the context of higher than expected inflation and changing monetary policy expectations, and on the other hand an easing contribution from banks’ liquidity situation in light of the still accommodative monetary policy. Banks indicated a similar assessment of the main drivers of credit standards on loans to SMEs and large firms (see Chart 2). For both, higher risk perceptions were the main contributor to the net tightening of credit standards in the first quarter of 2022.
Chart 1
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “bank’s capital and the costs related to bank’s capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.
Chart 2

(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards and contributing factors)
Note: See the notes on Chart 1.
In the largest euro area countries, credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in Germany, Spain and Italy, while they remained unchanged in France in the first quarter of 2022. In Germany, Spain and Italy, higher risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance had a net tightening impact on credit standards, while these factors had a neutral impact in France. Banks’ funding cost and balance sheet position had a net easing impact in France, driven by banks’ favourable liquidity position, and a net tightening impact in Italy, owing to higher bank funding cost and a tightening impact of banks’ access to market financing in the first quarter of 2022.
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect credit standards for loans to firms to tighten considerably (net percentage of 21%), for both loans to SMEs (net percentage of 21%) and to large firms (net percentage of 23%), against the background of the high uncertainty regarding the impact of the war in Ukraine on the economic outlook and firms’ credit risks. In addition, the impact of the anticipated less accommodative monetary policy on banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet position likely played a role in banks’ expectations, as also suggested by banks’ indications on the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes over the coming six months (see Section 3). Compared with previous episodes, the expected net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms was similar to that observed in the July 2020 survey, at the height of the pandemic credit risk concerns, and before that in the January 2012 survey, as the euro area sovereign debt crisis intensified.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 1.
2.1.2 Terms and conditions on loans to enterprises tightened somewhat
Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e. banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened somewhat in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of 3%, after 0%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). This was mainly on account of a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans (net percentage of 12%; margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates), whereas margins on average loans widened moderately (net percentage of 4%). The wider loan margins are so far not yet reflected in firms’ overall broadly stable actual aggregate cost of bank borrowing at the euro area level, which is available until February 2022, although aggregate developments somewhat mask differences across countries (see below). Banks also reported somewhat stricter collateral requirements and higher non-interest charges, which contributed to the net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to firms, while there was a slight net easing impact from the size of loans or credit lines. Developments in overall terms and conditions and their components were similar for loans to SMEs and large firms in the first quarter of 2022 (see Chart 4).

(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “non-interest rate charges”, “size of the loan or credit line”, “loan covenants” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Chart 4
Changes in terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Note: See the notes on Chart 3.
Banks’ higher capital costs and higher risk perceptions were the main drivers of the net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to firms in the first quarter of 2022 (see Table 3). Banks indicated a net tightening impact of their capital costs, reflecting the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine on banks’ equity valuations as well as the increase in bank bond yields. In addition, the heightened uncertainty and concerns about firms’ credit risks due to the surge in input costs and possible exposures to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus led to a net tightening impact of risk perceptions. Banks’ lower risk tolerance also had a net tightening impact on banks’ overall terms and conditions and margins, in particular for riskier loans.

Table 3
Factors contributing to changes in overall terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to enterprises
(net percentages of banks)
Notes: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing. See the notes on Chart 1.
In the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions on loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened, on balance, in Italy, remained unchanged in Germany and Spain, and eased in France in the first quarter of 2022. Margins on average and riskier loans to firms widened in France and Italy, while in Germany margins widened only for riskier loans. In Spain, loan margins remained, on balance, generally unchanged. The widening of loan margins in Germany and France is in line with the recent increases in bank lending rates to firms in these two countries, while actual lending rates for firms have not yet increased in Spain and Italy compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 (data available until February 2022). The net easing of overall terms and conditions in France was related to the size of loans or credit lines available. Risk perceptions contributed to a tightening of overall terms and conditions in most countries, except for Spain, in line with the widening of margins on riskier loans. Banks in Italy also reported a tightening contribution of banks’ cost of funds and a lower risk tolerance.
2.1.3 Rejection rate for loans to enterprises increased
In the first quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a net increase in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for loans to firms (net percentage of 4%, after 0% in the previous quarter). This development is broadly in line with the development of credit standards, pointing to some tightening of loan approval criteria. The net increase in the share of rejected loan applications was broadly the same for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 4%) and loans to large firms (net percentage of 3%).
Across the largest euro area countries, banks reported that the share of rejected applications remained unchanged in net terms for loans to firms in Germany and France in the first quarter of 2022, whereas it increased in Spain and decreased in Italy. Developments were similar across firm sizes in France and Italy, while in Spain the net increase was more pronounced for SMEs than for large firms. In Germany, the share of loan rejections increased slightly for SMEs, but remained stable in net terms for large firms. These differences across firm sizes may reflect that risks are more difficult to assess or higher for smaller firms and that competitive pressure may be larger for lending to large firms.
2.1.4 Net demand for loans to enterprises continued to increase
Banks reported a continued net increase in firms’ demand for loans or credit lines in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 17%, after 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Chart 5 and Overview table). Loan demand increased, in net terms, for long-term maturities (net percentage of 12%), reflecting the continued economic recovery at the beginning of the year and the anticipation of less accommodative monetary policy. It also increased, to a smaller extent, for short-term maturities in the first quarter, according to banks (net percentage of 6%), likely related to supply chain disruptions, as well as precautionary inventories and liquidity holdings. These developments are overall in line with actual loan growth, for which data are available until February 2022. In addition, banks indicated that loan demand picked up for both SMEs (net percentage of 14%) and large firms (net percentage of 16%, see Chart 6).
Chart 5
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks. Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.
Chart 6
Changes in demand for loans or credit lines to SMEs and large enterprises, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See notes on Chart 5. Developments across firm sizes in the factors having an impact on loan demand were added in the April 2022 survey round.
Loan demand was mainly driven by higher financing needs of firms for inventories and working capital, whereas the still positive contribution of fixed investment to loan demand moderated following its significant positive contribution in the previous quarter (see Chart 5 and Table 4). The higher financing needs for inventories and working capital reflect supply chain disruptions and higher input costs, especially due to the surge in energy prices and may also reflect precautionary inventories and liquidity holdings. In addition, banks reported a positive impact of the low general level of interest rates, which was higher than in the previous quarter, suggesting higher loan demand from firms to secure currently low financing costs for longer, against the background of expectations of less accommodative monetary policy. Loan demand was also supported, on balance, by other financing needs, which include mergers and acquisitions activity and debt refinancing and restructuring, and by the use of alternative sources of financing, like loans from other banks or non-banks and market-based debt financing. Across firm sizes, banks reported that large firms in particular increased their loan demand for inventories and working capital in the first quarter of 2022, which may suggest that they are more exposed to supply chain disruptions than SMEs (see Chart 6). In addition, alternative external financing sources, lower debt securities issuance in particular, have supported bank loan demand from large firms, according to the reporting banks, while this was, on balance, not the case for SMEs. By contrast, loan demand from SMEs appears to have been driven more strongly by the current low level of interest rates and fixed investment.

(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 5.
In the largest euro area countries, banks reported a net increase in demand for loans to firms in Germany and France, while loan demand remained unchanged according to banks in Spain and decreased in Italy in the first quarter of 2022. Financing needs for fixed investment and for working capital as well as the low general level of interest rates had a considerable positive impact on loan demand in Germany and France. In addition, in France, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing and restructuring as well as alternative sources of external financing supported loan demand from firms. By contrast, lower loan demand from firms in Italy was driven by a dampening impact of debt refinancing and restructuring, mergers and acquisitions and the general level of interest rates. For firms in Spain, banks indicated fixed investment and mergers and acquisitions as supporting loan demand, whereas firms’ internal funds dampened their loan demand in the first quarter of 2022.
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a continued net increase in demand for loans to firms (net percentage of banks at 12%), for both SMEs and large firms (net percentage of 11% for both firm sizes). Demand for short-term loans is expected to increase significantly (net percentage of 21%), signalling expectations of higher financing needs due to increased input costs and possibly lasting supply chain disruptions. By contrast, banks expect demand for long-term loans to decrease slightly in net terms (net percentage of -2%), in line with expectations of a dampening impact of the war and the related heightened uncertainty on firms’ fixed investment.
2.2 Loans to households for house purchase
2.2.1 Credit standards for loans to households for house purchase tightened slightly
In the first quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a slight net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of banks at 2%, after 0% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Chart 7 and Overview table), broadly in line with expectations reported in the previous survey round, and below the historical average for credit standards (6%).
Chart 7
Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “bank’s capital and the costs related to bank’s capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “housing market prospects, including expected house price developments” and “borrower’s creditworthiness”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards, currently mainly related to macroprudential policy recommendations.
Perceptions of increased risk and – to a lesser extent – lower risk tolerance contributed to the net tightening of credit standards (see Chart 7 and Table 5). Banks reported an increase in perceived risks for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2020, stemming from housing market prospects, the general economic outlook and borrower creditworthiness. With the exception of the pandemic period, this is the first net tightening impact of risk perceptions since 2014. It likely reflects the increased uncertainty and the economic impact related to the war in Ukraine. It also reflects general concerns about housing markets and borrower creditworthiness as house prices continue to increase, housing lending volumes remain dynamic and bank lending rates for housing loans have started increasing. At the same time, competition from banks and non-banks, and banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a broadly neutral impact on credit standards for housing loans.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards tightened in net terms in Germany, eased in Italy and remained unchanged in Spain and France. Banks in Germany and Italy reported a net tightening contribution of risk perceptions related to the general economic outlook as well as housing market prospects, while banks in Germany and France reported higher risk perceptions regarding individual borrowers’ creditworthiness. In addition, German banks reported a net tightening impact from their lower risk tolerance as well as from the cost of funds and balance sheet constraints related to higher capital costs and less favourable access to market funding. At the same time, banks in France reported a net easing impact of cost of funds and balance sheet constraints driven by the contribution of their liquidity position.
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a moderate, but more pronounced, net tightening of credit standards on loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of banks of 8%).

Note: See the notes on Chart 7.
2.2.2 Terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase tightened moderately
Banks reported a moderate net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 6%, after -1% in the previous quarter; see Chart 8 and Table 6). This mainly reflects a slight net tightening of loan-to-value ratios (part of other terms and conditions in Chart 8 and Table 6). At the same time, margins on average loans eased in net terms, while margins on riskier loans remained broadly unchanged. These results imply that the recently observed increases in interest rates for housing loans are more pronounced for riskier borrowers, while banks have not yet fully passed through increased funding costs to average loans, leading to lower margins for these loans.

Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “loan-to-value ratio”, “other loan size limits”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Table 6
Changes in terms and conditions on loans to households for house purchase
(net percentages of banks)
Note: See the notes on Chart 8.
In line with this, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet constraints contributed to a net tightening of overall terms and conditions and margins, while pressure from competition had a net easing impact (see Table 7). Furthermore, a deterioration in banks’ risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance contributed to tighter overall terms and conditions, while not affecting margins – with the exception of a slight widening impact of risk perceptions on riskier loan margins.
In the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions for housing loans tightened in net terms in Germany, France and Italy, and eased in Spain. Wider margins on riskier loans contributed to the tightening in Germany and Italy, while German banks also reported tighter collateral requirements, loan-to-value ratios and other loan size limits, likely reflecting the macroprudential recommendations targeting residential real estate markets in Germany.

]
Both in Germany and Italy, increased risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance contributed to the tightening, while in Italy funding costs also contributed considerably to the tightening. At the same time, margins on average loans narrowed in Spain and France, and in France margins on riskier loans also narrowed, mainly on account of competitive pressures.

Note: The net percentages for these questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.
2.2.3 Rejection rate for housing loans remained broadly unchanged
In the first quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported, on balance, a broadly unchanged share of rejected formal and informal applications for housing loans (1%, after 2% in the previous quarter).
Across the largest euro area countries, the rejection rate for housing loans remained unchanged in Germany, Spain, France and Italy.
2.2.4 Net demand for housing loans continued to increase
Banks reported a continued increase in net demand for housing loans in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of banks of 10%, after 8% in the fourth quarter of 2021; see Chart 9 and Overview table), in line with the dynamic housing loan flows in the first two months of 2022.
Chart 9
Changes in demand for loans to households for house purchase, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 5. “Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation” and “regulatory and fiscal regime of housing markets”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal finance of house purchase out of savings/down payment”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”.
The low general level of interest rates and – to a lesser extent – housing market prospects contributed, in net terms, to an increase in housing loan demand (see Chart 9 and Table 8). The positive net impact of the level of interest rates on loan demand, despite rates on housing loans starting to increase since the beginning of 2022, may reflect anticipation effects of further increases in interest rates as bank funding costs rise. This interpretation is supported by the fact that this factor is particularly relevant in Germany where rates had already increased for five consecutive months up to February 2022. The positive net contribution of housing market prospects to loan demand decreased further compared with previous quarters, pointing to potential vulnerabilities, in line with the tightening contribution of this factor to credit standards. In addition, other financing needs contributed moderately to a net increase in demand, while consumer confidence and the use of alternative finance had a broadly neutral impact.
Across the largest euro area countries, banks in Germany and Spain reported a net increase in housing loan demand in the first quarter of 2022, whereas banks in France reported unchanged demand for housing loans, and Italian banks reported a net decrease. In Germany, the low level of interest rates was the most important factor contributing to the net increase in demand, which may indicate that borrowers aim to secure the currently still low lending rates for longer-term real estate borrowing. In addition, housing market prospects and other financing needs supported loan demand in Germany. In Spain, consumer confidence and housing market prospects mainly contributed positively to housing loan demand, while households’ use of loans from other banks contributed to a net decline. By contrast, the current level of interest rates contributed to a net decline in housing loan demand in France and Italy. In addition, in Italy, lower consumer confidence, lower housing market prospects and the use of alternative financing had a negative impact on demand.
In the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a net decline in the demand for housing loans (net percentage of banks of -10%).

Note: See the notes on Chart 9.
2.3 Consumer credit and other lending to households
2.3.1 Credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households eased moderately
Banks reported a moderate net easing for credit standards on consumer credit and other lending to households in the first quarter of 2022 (net percentage of -5%; see Chart 10 and Overview table), following a similarly moderate net easing (-4%) of credit standards in the previous BLS round.
Increased risk tolerance on the part of banks mainly contributed to the net easing in credit standards (see Chart 10 and Table 9). Risk perceptions relating to the broad economic outlook had a marginal contribution towards a net easing, while all other factors had broadly neutral effects.
Across the largest euro area countries, credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households eased in Italy and France, owing to increased risk tolerance. In addition, lower risk perceptions relating to the general economic outlook and the risk on the collateral demanded had an easing impact for banks in France. Banks in Germany and Spain reported unchanged credit standards.
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect a moderate net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 7%).

Notes: See the notes on Chart 1. “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “bank’s capital and the costs related to bank’s capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “Risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “creditworthiness of consumers” and “risk on the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks” and “competition from non-banks”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards.

2.3.2 Terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households eased slightly
In the first quarter of 2022, banks’ overall terms and conditions applied when granting consumer credit and other lending to households eased slightly (net percentage of -2%, after -1% in the previous quarter; see Chart 11 and Table 10). This was because of a considerable narrowing of margins for average loans (net percentage of -12%) and a more moderate narrowing for riskier loans (-4%).
Chart 11
Changes in terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households
(net percentages of banks reporting a tightening of terms and conditions)
Notes: “Margins” are defined as the spread over a relevant market reference rate. “Other terms and conditions” is the unweighted average of “size of the loan”, “non-interest rate charges” and “maturity”. The net percentages for “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in terms and conditions.
Pressure from competition continued to have a moderate net easing impact (see Table 11). In line with developments in credit standards, increased risk tolerance also had a slight easing impact. By contrast, banks’ costs of funds and balance sheet constraints had a small tightening effect on terms and conditions, likely reflecting the tightening of banks’ market-based funding conditions. Risk perceptions had a broadly neutral impact.
Across the largest euro area countries, overall terms and conditions on consumer credit and other lending to households eased in net terms in France, tightened in Italy, and remained broadly unchanged in Spain and Germany. A narrowing of margins on both average and riskier loans contributed to the easing in France, and was driven by pressure from competition, improved risk perceptions and increased risk tolerance. By contrast, French banks reported that their cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had a net tightening effect. The reported tightening of terms and conditions in Italy is the result of increases in non-interest charges. By contrast, Italian banks reported a narrowing of margins on average loans, but margins on riskier loans were unchanged. In Germany, while overall terms and conditions were unchanged, margins on both average and riskier loans narrowed moderately, reflecting a net easing contribution of banks’ funding costs.

2.3.3 Rejection rate for consumer credit and other lending to households decreased slightly
In the first quarter of 2022, euro area banks reported a slight net decrease in the share of rejected formal and informal applications for consumer credit and other lending to households (-2%, after -3% in the previous survey round). This is consistent with the reported net easing in credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households in the first quarter of 2022.
Across the largest euro area countries, the rejection rate decreased on balance in Germany, Italy and France, whereas it increased in Spain.
2.3.4 Net demand for consumer credit and other lending to households increased
In the first quarter of 2022, banks reported a net increase in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of banks at 11%, after 2% in the previous quarter; see Chart 12 and Overview table), which was higher than in the previous quarter. This is broadly in line with recently observed increases in the annual growth rate of credit for consumption.
Chart 12
Changes in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households, and contributing factors
(net percentages of banks reporting an increase in demand, and contributing factors)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 5. “Use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing out of savings”, “loans from other banks” and “other sources of external finance”. “Consumption exp. (real estate)” denotes “consumption expenditure financed through real estate-guaranteed loans”.
Spending on durable goods made the largest positive contribution to demand for consumer credit, in contrast with a slight negative effect in the previous quarter (see Chart 12 and Table 12). In addition, consumer confidence continued to have a moderate positive impact in the first quarter of 2022, despite the decline in the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator in March 2022. The general level of interest rates, use of alternative finance or alternative bank loans and mortgage equity withdrawal all had no strong effect on demand for consumer credit in the first quarter of 2022.
Across all four largest euro area countries, banks reported a net increase in demand for consumer credit. Higher spending on durables partially explained the net increase in demand in all countries, while in Germany, Spain and France higher consumer confidence also contributed to the net increase in demand. On the other hand, French banks reported that the general level of interest rates contributed negatively to demand for consumer credit, and Italian banks stated that internal financing out of savings had a dampening impact. In Germany, loans from other banks had a slight negative contribution to net demand.
In the second quarter of 2022, banks expect demand for consumer credit and other lending to remain broadly unchanged (net percentage of 1%).

3 Ad hoc questions
3.1 Banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding
The April 2022 survey included a question asking banks to assess the extent to which the situation in the financial markets has affected their access to retail and wholesale funding.
In the first quarter of 2022, banks reported that their access to money markets, securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, reflecting the tightening of market-based funding conditions for banks. By contrast, access to retail funding remained broadly unchanged (net percentage of -1% reported deteriorated access, after -5% in 2021 Q4, see Chart 13 and Table 13). In detail, access to short-term deposit funding continued to improve, whereas access to long-term deposits remained broadly unchanged in the first quarter of 2022. This is consistent with actual developments in deposits held by firms and households. Household deposit inflows remained robust in the first two months of 2022, and deposit flows of firms, which declined at the start of the year, increased strongly again in February 2022, likely reflecting a re-emergence of precautionary liquidity holdings due to supply chain disruptions and high uncertainty because of the war in Ukraine.

(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)

Table 13
Banks’ assessment of funding conditions and the ability to transfer credit risk off the balance sheet
(net percentages of banks reporting a deterioration in market access)
Note: See the notes on Chart 13.
In the second quarter of 2022, euro area banks expect, on balance, a continued deterioration in their access to money markets, debt securities and securitisation, which may partly reflect the anticipation of less accommodative monetary policy. In addition, they expect a slight deterioration in their access to retail funding.
3.2 The impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes
The April 2022 survey questionnaire included two biannual ad hoc questions gauging the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes. When answering the questions on the impact of those programmes over the past and next six months, banks were asked to take into account the impact of the ECB’s net asset purchases and the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased. Banks were also asked to consider both the direct and indirect effects of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes.
3.2.1 Impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on banks’ financial situation
Euro area banks reported, in net terms, that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes continued to have a positive impact on their liquidity position and their market financing conditions, but led to a deterioration in their profitability over the past six months (see Charts 14 and 15). Compared with their indications in the October 2021 BLS, banks reported, in net terms, a smaller positive impact of the ECB’s asset purchases for the period from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022 on their liquidity position (net percentage of 8%, after 26%) and market financing conditions (net percentage of 13%, after 28%). In addition, they indicated a continued positive impact on their total assets (net percentage of 6%, after 9%), in line with the reported positive impact on lending volumes (see below). At the same time, banks continued to indicate a negative impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on their profitability (net percentage of -7%, after -11%), mainly owing to the negative impact on their net interest income (net percentage of -11%, after -21%).

(net percentages of banks reporting an increase/improvement)
Notes: See the notes on Chart 14. The last period denotes expectations indicated by banks in the current round.
Over the next six months, euro area banks expect, on balance, that the positive impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on their liquidity position and market financing conditions will turn into a negative impact (net percentages of banks of -6% and -12%, respectively). The expected deterioration is likely related to the envisaged scaling down of monetary policy accommodation, specifically the end of the ECB’s net asset purchases under the PEPP in March 2022 and the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases under the APP over the next six months. In addition, banks expect a continued negative impact of the ECB’s asset purchases on their profitability (net percentage of -11%), driven by the negative impact on net interest income, but also due to expected capital losses.
3.2.2 Impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on banks’ lending conditions and lending volumes
Over the past six months, euro area banks reported a net easing impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes on their terms and conditions for loans to enterprises and housing loans (net percentages of banks of -7% and -3%, respectively), while the impact was neutral for consumer credit (0%; see Chart 16). Regarding credit standards, banks reported a moderate net easing impact for loans to firms (net percentage of -4%). By contrast, the impact on credit standards was neutral for loans to households over the past six months.

Combined fiscal and monetary response kept financial fragmentation in check during pandemic
Resilient financial integration vital for euro area economy and financial sector
EU equity markets need further promotion to finance green and digital transformations
The financial fragmentation in the euro area that occurred at the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was reversed relatively quickly, the European Central Bank (ECB)’s latest report on Financial Integration and Structure in the Euro Area shows. Once pre-pandemic levels of integration were regained, financial integration increased further and remained resilient to pressure from further waves of infections. The most influential policy interventions that initially kept fragmentation contained, and then brought integration back to pre-pandemic levels, were the series of ECB monetary policy measures and the European Union (EU) agreement on a sizeable coronavirus recovery fund.
The biennial ECB Financial Integration and Structure in the Euro Area report focuses on financial integration, changes in financial structure and the process of financial development and modernisation. It also discusses selected financial sector policies, notably those related to the European banking union and capital markets union. In this way, the report contributes to the debate on how European Economic and Monetary Union can be deepened.
Thanks to decisive policy responses, financing of euro area firms and households held up during the pandemic, although this required a significant increase in public debt. In addition to fiscal support and guarantees, another factor that helped non-financial corporations to stabilise was a rapid shift in their financing mix towards bank credit lines and corporate debt issuance, which was also facilitated by monetary policy measures. The rise in non-bank financial intermediation continued, with especially strong growth in investment funds, most notably in equity funds.
The coronavirus crisis substantially restricted private consumption risk sharing across euro area countries, consequently limiting one of the benefits of financial integration and development. The major fiscal initiatives at the EU level, such as the NextGenerationEU recovery programme and the three safety nets for businesses, jobs and workers, were key to ensuring risk sharing among member countries and compensating for hampered private financial channels.
The NextGenerationEU programme provides a unique historical opportunity to bring private risk capital markets in the euro area and EU to levels similar to those in other major economies. Enhanced private forces would have to join public ones to ensure sufficient innovation and prepare the ground for financing the green, digital and other technological transformations. The coronavirus pandemic and recent geopolitical events have further underlined the need to accelerate the EU’s green and digital “twin transition”.
Completing the banking union and making material progress with the capital markets union remain important.
Implementation of the 2020 capital markets union action plan ­­– in particular the digital European Single Access Point and the reviews of EU public listing rules and of fund and insurance regulations – could produce tangible progress in the development and integration of European public and private equity markets. This is because the plan’s implementation is an important contribution to enabling the large technological transformations that are needed. The path of making insolvency frameworks more efficient and harmonised across member countries also needs to be continued. Even more effort will be necessary to build a vibrant EU equity ecosystem – for example, to facilitate the scale-up phase of successful companies.
Debt issuance procedures also need to be further integrated and harmonised to reduce costs and allow investors to better diversify across EU countries. As domestic and cross-border bank consolidation could help address structurally low profitability and fragmentation in retail credit markets, removing remaining regulatory obstacles should be considered.
A statistical (online) annex has been released alongside this report. Since March 2020, the ECB has released, on a biannual basis, a streamlined set of indicators covering both financial integration and financial structure.

,"This is the second edition of the European Central Bank’s biennial report on financial integration and structure in the euro area. As explained in greater detail in the preface to the first edition in March 2020,

it is designed to focus on structural developments in the financial system of the euro area, and in some cases also of the European Union (EU), and related policy issues. In so doing, it covers developments in financial integration across member countries, changes in financial structure (the mixture of financial markets and intermediaries) and financial development or modernisation (for example through innovations in the financial system). Definitions of these three concepts and how they link to Eurosystem tasks and functions were provided in more detail in the 2020 preface.
The findings of this report may touch upon issues relevant for the policy discussion related to the European banking union (BU), the European capital markets union (CMU) and thereby on the financial aspects of deepening Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
The report has been streamlined in two ways compared with the previous issue: by focusing on the main trends in financial integration, structure and development, and by replacing special feature articles with more concise boxes. The topics covered by the five boxes are the following:
Making euro area equity markets fit for green and digital innovation;
Measuring market-based and non-bank financing of non-financial corporations in the euro area;
Frictions in debt issuance procedures and home bias in the euro area;
Home bias in green bond markets;
A deep dive into capital risk sharing in the euro area – inter- versus intra-regional risk sharing.
The standard set of indicators of financial integration and structure and their descriptions are included in an online Statistical Annex.
The report does not cover the implications of Russia’s military attack on Ukraine for the euro area or the EU financial system, as the data cut-off date was 11 February 2022.
Key messages
1 Overall assessment of financial structure and integration
The surveillance parts of this report cover developments in euro area financial structure, in terms of both financing instruments and financial intermediaries, as well as in euro area financial integration during the COVID pandemic period. The economic and financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the sizeable policy responses dominated most of the two-year reporting period of this report. There were, however, also a number of previous features and trends in financial structure and integration that continued or evolved differently during the last two years. The surveillance parts of the report – summarised in this section – describe the most important patterns in both regards. They consider aggregate and sectoral developments for different financing instruments (liability perspective) and for different financial intermediaries (notably from an asset perspective). They also review the integration of financial markets across member states and its resilience as well as assess risk sharing across member states.
Thanks to a decisive set of policy responses the financing of euro area firms and households held up during the pandemic crisis, although this required a significant increase in public debt. As seen in Chart 1.1, aggregate external financing of both non-financial corporations (NFCs, left-hand panel) and households (middle panel) broadly held up in the euro area during the pandemic (blue lines in 2020 and 2021 compared to the years before). But this was only possible thanks to the fast and formidable policy support and actions that fiscal authorities, the Eurosystem and prudential authorities and bodies undertook in response to the pandemic. For example, the right-hand panel of Chart 1.1 visualises this in terms of the multiplication of public debt issuance necessary to finance measures supporting firms and households. The speed and decisiveness of the action clearly benefited from the experiences with the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis a decade earlier and subsequent reforms.

Notes: MFI stands for Monetary and Financial Institutions. Non-MFIs include other financial institutions (OFIs) as well as insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs). ""Other"" is the difference between the total and the instruments included in the figure and includes inter-company loans and the rebalancing between non-financial and financial accounts data. Figures shown represent the sum of flows over the last four quarters at the end of Q4 for 2017 to 2020 and of Q3 for 2021.
In addition to fiscal support and guarantees, another factor helping non-financial corporations to stabilise was a fast change in their financing mix towards bank credit lines and corporate debt issuance, as also facilitated by various monetary policy measures. While total NFC financing held up overall, the pandemic triggered large swings in its composition. Notably, in 2020 trade credit and public equity issuance dried up (grey and green blocks in Chart 1.1), because of the great uncertainty about the viability of firms during lockdowns early in the crisis and a rush towards liquidity (“dash for cash”). At the same time, NFCs resorted more to debt financing, both through bank loans and through corporate debt securities (yellow and red blocks). Robustified by regulatory reforms decided after the Great Financial Crisis and supported by special ECB liquidity operations, banks were able to let firms draw elastically on their credit lines. In addition, much enhanced corporate bond purchases by the ECB through its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) made corporate issuance attractive.
Multiple support to companies was all the more important as the corporate sector could be regarded as the economic epicentre of the COVID crisis. The initially necessary social distancing and lockdowns very much limited the operations of firms in important sectors, constraining the employment of people earning wages, investment and the production, distribution and sale of goods and services. Therefore, the risks spread within the corporate sector and from there to supporting governments, financial intermediaries and consumers. One challenge for the future will be how the pandemic legacy of corporate debt will be resolved, including through the functioning of insolvency frameworks.
The trend towards non-bank financial intermediation continued, with an especially strong growth of investments funds, in particular for equity funds, despite some initial stresses in some segments of the fund sector. Turning from the perspective of financing instruments to the one of financial intermediaries, a trend that existed at least since the Great Financial Crisis is the growth of non-bank financial intermediaries in the euro area. For example, the share of non-banks in the provision of credit to NFCs grew from around 15 per cent at the time of the Great Financial Crisis to almost 30 per cent in 2021 (see panel b of Chart A in Box 2 of this report). A particularly strongly growing type of non-bank intermediary during the last two years were investment funds (green line in panel a of Chart 1.2), notably driven by equity funds (blue line). This reflected not only valuation effects on the back of strong fiscal support and monetary policy measures but also high inflows over a number of quarters. Apart from the low interest rate environment, the enhanced interest in portfolio equity investment may have been driven by the strong performance of stock markets until the cut-off date of this report. Finally, as of late also insurance corporations and pension funds increased their equity holdings, partly through the purchase of investment funds (Chart 9 in the main chapter of the report).

Contrary to previous major crises, a material decrease in euro area financial integration induced by the beginning of the pandemic – and more pronounced in prices than in quantities – stopped and reversed relatively quickly. Turning to euro area financial integration, Chart 1.3 shows the ECB’s two composite indicators that provide an aggregate picture of integration across the main market segments (money, bond, equity and banking markets) in terms of prices (blue line) and quantities (yellow line) since the start of the euro. The price-based indicator suggests that the moderated and volatile recovery of integration after the Great Financial Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis reported in the 2020 report was still intact until the cut-off date. Quantity-based integration (capturing cross-border bond holdings, equity holdings and interbank lending), however, moved broadly sideways for a number of years and only recovered somewhat more recently. The levels of integration measured with the latest data now compare to those of the mid-2000s, i.e. a few years before the financial crisis. Most importantly, the adverse effects of the COVID crisis on financial integration, while material in particular in terms of cross-border price divergences, seem to have been relatively short-lived both in prices and in quantities.

(quarterly data; price-based indicator: Q1 1995 – Q4 2021; quantity-based indicator: Q1 1999 – Q4 2021)
Source: ECB and ECB calculations.
Notes: The price-based composite indicator aggregates ten indicators for money, bond, equity and retail banking markets, the quantity-based composite indicator aggregates five indicators for the same market segments except retail banking. The indicators are bounded between zero (full fragmentation) and one (full integration). Increases in the indicators signal greater financial integration. From January 2018 onwards the behaviour of the price-based indicator may have changed due to the transition from EONIA to €STR interest rates in the money market component. OMT stands for Outright Monetary Transactions. For a detailed description of the indicators and their input data, see the Statistical Web Annex to this report and Hoffmann, P., Kremer, M. and Zaharia, S. (2019), Financial integration in Europe through the lens of composite indicators, Working Paper Series, No 2319, ECB, September.
The most influential policy measures that first contained re-fragmentation in the euro area and then brought it back to pre-pandemic levels were first a prompt series of ECB monetary policy measures and then, decisively, the EU agreement about a very sizeable COVID recovery fund. To analyse in greater depth what happened with integration during the pandemic crisis, Chart 1.4 zooms in on the period February 2020 to February 2022. This is only possible with a high-frequency version of the price-based composite indicator (blue line), which is complemented with information about the severity of the crisis (various dashed lines), economic activity (red dots) and important events and policy actions (numbered and colour coded vertical lines). The chart first confirms the sharp re-fragmentation (and economic contraction) triggered by the first COVID wave and severe lockdown measures. Initial policy measures – including notably the ECB’s PEPP (e.g. events 7, 9 and 16) – were able to contain this development but not sustainably reverse it yet. Only when the two key proposals for a sizeable European recovery fund (events 24 and 25) combined with a number of other measures and developments a sustainable re-integration was set in motion. These other developments included particularly the previous adoption of three European safety nets for businesses, jobs and workers (event 17), the easing of the first virus wave (dashed orange and violet lines) and a sharp economic recovery. Thereafter, following also an expansion of the PEPP (event 26) and the European Council’s agreement on the NextGenerationEU recovery fund financed through the joint issuance of debt (events 28 and 29), the price-based composite ultimately reached pre-pandemic levels.

Notes: The price-based composite indicator of financial integration is a high-frequency version (daily readings) of the one by Hoffmann et al. (2019), described in Borgioli et al. (2020). The indicator is calibrated to vary between 0 and 1. The COVID-19 deaths data series are measured as seven day moving averages. Fully vaccinated is the share relative total population. Industrial production growth (excluding construction) is measured as growth rate to the previous month. Lockdown stringency varies between 0 and 100 (100 = strictest) and is computed as an average of the COVID-19 stringency indexes of all euro area countries, weighted by their 2019 real GDP. It is based on nine response indicators including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans. PEPP stands for Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and SURE for Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency. The chart distinguishes between four phases of the crisis, indicated by the grey and light blue shaded areas. The first captures the first infection wave, with drastic lockdowns and a severe economic downturn (mid-February to early May 2020). The second phase covers the stark economic rebound when infections had returned to low levels and member countries partly opened up again (early May to mid/late-August 2020). The third phase spans the severe return of infections in three more waves with, however, more targeted lockdowns and a more resilient economy than during the first phase (mid/late-August 2020 to end May 2021). The fourth phase is characterized by a combination of the rise in the number of COVID-19 new cases (including Delta and Omicron variants) together with the low number of deaths, high vaccination rates, and more resilience of financial integration (since June 2021 until February 2022).

Once pre-pandemic levels were reached again, measured financial integration gradually further increased and remained resilient to further COVID waves. Following the establishment of the comprehensive set of national and European fiscal, monetary and prudential policy instruments, Chart 1.4 clearly shows how euro area financial integration remained resilient to the later waves of the coronavirus and its variants, as also national lockdown measures become less severe and eventually vaccinations picked up (dashed green line). If anything, integration further increased in the following quarters. The experience overall illustrates, among other things, how powerful aligned monetary and fiscal policies can be in stabilising financial markets specifically and the euro area more generally during a crisis.
As flagged in the 2020 report, however, the resilience of integration to large shocks needs to be continuously monitored. For example, while the ratio of intra-euro area foreign equity investments relative to foreign debt investments has somewhat recovered during the pandemic (Chart 18 in the main chapter of the report), the ratio of intra-euro area foreign direct investment relative to combined FDI and portfolio equity investments continued to decline (Chart 19 in the main body). The former should increase the resilience of financial integration and the latter decrease it.
Measured quantity-based integration of the European Union green bond market may gradually decrease over time, from an initial high level, as all member states develop local bond supply and domestic investors have local alternatives (“home bias” effect). A particularly highly integrated European market is the relatively new market for green bonds. Box 4 of the report, however, finds that the limited investor home bias in this market (member countries’ investors holding a relatively large share of green bonds issued in other euro area countries) may have to do with the local underdevelopment of this market in some member countries. As soon as the domestic market develops and there is a greater local supply of green bonds, investors from these countries tend to reduce their foreign holdings to buy more domestically issued bonds and the green home bias increases, as a consequence. Although this process seems to be quite gradual, it may lead to a reduction of quantity-based integration measured in this market over time.
The nature of the COVID crisis very much restricted private consumption risk sharing across euro area countries, limiting one of the benefits of financial integration and development. An important economic benefit expected from financial integration and development in the euro area is risk sharing across member countries. The associated financial flows are expected to help households to better stabilise income and consumption in the face of shocks. While estimates suggest that income risk sharing has been relatively stable over the last years and the pandemic – in contrast to the Great Financial Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis –, it also remains at relatively low levels (Chart 23 in the main body of the report). At the same time, the nature of the COVID crisis restricted key private channels for consumption risk sharing, since public health measures, mobility restrictions and production constraints limited households in consuming their regular consumption baskets. Given the long data windows with which consumption risk sharing needs to be estimated, the measured moderate recovery – driven much by the credit channel but starting from a relatively low level – is still likely to be related to the resolution of the previous crises (Chart 24 in the main body). Box 5 of the report presents a historical analysis of the capital channel of risk sharing and confirms the relatively moderate contribution of this channel for the years following the European twin crises. Distinguishing a region of Northern euro area countries and a region of Southern euro area countries, it also finds that most of the capital channel operates within those regions rather than across them and that the inter-regional capital channel is particularly weak for the South.
The major fiscal initiatives at the EU level, such as the NextGenerationEU recovery programme and the three safety nets for business, jobs and workers, were key for ensuring risk sharing among member countries and for compensating for the hampered private financial channels. Given the nature and severity of the COVID crisis, it was therefore critical that the hampered private risk sharing channels were swiftly complemented with fiscal channels. This was all the more important, as the European Economic and Monetary Union does not include a fiscal union and therefore the fiscal risk sharing channel in the euro area is typically estimated as very small (Chart 24 in the main body). Sizeable fiscal risk sharing mechanisms were established with the three EU safety nets for businesses, jobs and workers and, notably, the NextGenerationEU pandemic recovery programme. From 2021 to 2026 NGEU can mobilise funds in the order of 6 per cent of EU GDP, with a significant annual volume of debt issuance at the European level. A large share of the NGEU grants and loans will be distributed to the countries most affected by the pandemic. Moreover, due to the joint backing of debt by all EU member states loans can be made available at favourable conditions. Pay-outs have started towards the end of 2021 and about a third of NGEU funds are expected to be used by the end of 2022. All this brings fiscal risk sharing in the EU to another level for a number of years, as the programme is designed to be temporary. But the success of the associated investments and reforms is expected to have a significant impact on the future debate on fiscal integration in the EU.
2 Selected policy issues for financial structure and integration
Completing the Banking Union and making material progress with the Capital Markets Union are key to enhance the integration and resilience of the financial sector and help Europe's post-COVID recovery. The description and assessments of financial integration and financial structure trends in the euro area and the EU in the previous section illustrate that there remain significant challenges ahead. Both as a consequence of the pandemic and as a consequence of otherwise existing trends. With the Banking Union (BU) and the Capital Markets Union (CMU) the EU has two interrelated projects under which many are already tackled, or new ones can be addressed going forward. A strong and integrated EU financial sector is essential to the EU’s post-recovery ambitions and requires a robust BU as well as an ambitiously deepened CMU, including in its green dimensions. The BU has come a long way since 2012, but further progress needs to be made on key missing elements, such as improving the crisis management framework or setting up a European deposit insurance scheme, and to ultimately complete the project. This would enable banks to conduct their business across the banking union without being hampered by national borders, allowing financing to reach the most promising projects. It would also make the banking sector more resilient. At the same time, the EU needs to urgently strengthen its financial markets beyond the banking segment. More developed and integrated capital markets would allow companies to diversify their funding sources, help mobilise investment across the Union and contribute to overall financial resilience, provided that the resilience of the non-bank financial sector is also strengthened so that it provides robust financing to companies in both normal and stressed market conditions.

Thus, the ECB welcomes the objectives of the European Commission’s second CMU action plan of September 2020 to achieve better access to finance for companies, make it safer for individuals to invest their savings and to better integrate EU capital markets. It supports the full and swift implementation of the envisaged reforms, including the proposals of November 2021
[

]
as well as outstanding actions such as on withholding tax and supervisory convergence. Alongside the advancement of the EU’s sustainable finance framework, these actions will also contribute to building a green CMU with sizeable, mature and integrated green capital markets.
[
4
]
The ECB also notes that more needs to be done to complete the single market for investment funds with more widespread cross-border distribution, because this promises to give investors more choice, reduce costs and fees, as recently also noted in a report by the European Court of Auditors (ECA).
[
5
]
Assessing the suitability of the regulatory framework, the ECA report highlights a lack of adequate and reliable data to mitigate risk to financial stability as a key concern and calls for strengthening ESMA’s role as a supervisor.
Selected areas discussed in the main body of this report that need enhanced policy efforts include equity markets, debt issuance procedures and bank consolidation. This section highlights a small number of policy considerations that emerge from the analysis presented in this report and go beyond the work already going on under the BU and CMU, at least in some dimensions. They touch on the role of more dynamic and integrated equity markets for financing European innovation, on better integrating European debt issuance procedures and on the need for further European bank consolidation.
The NextGenerationEU recovery and public investment programme provides a unique historical opportunity to bring private risk capital markets in the euro area and EU to similar levels as is the case for other major economies. This way, private and public forces together ensure enough innovation and prepare the ground for financing the green, digital and other technological transformations. The green and digital transformations require sizeable investments for achieving the necessary technological and commercial innovations. If anything, the COVID pandemic and recent geopolitical events have further underlined the need to accelerate the EU’s twin transition. The European Commission has estimated that the average additional investment effort until 2030 to meet the EU’s current green and digital ambitions amounts to €650 billion per year across the EU. While public investments under NGEU and its significant share in green and digital investments will mean material progress, the required efforts will not be possible without also very substantial private investment. The research literature clearly suggests that public and private equity markets are much more suitable for providing the necessary funding for relatively risky innovation-orientation investment than bank lending. Yet, the relevant equity market segments in the euro area are significantly smaller and less integrated compared to other major advanced economies, even though European risk capital markets have grown well during the last few years.
[

]
For example, Chart 2.1 compares the size of risk capital markets in the euro area and the United States. A particular bottleneck seems to be the small size of European venture capital funds and a resulting lack of large funding rounds, which particularly hamper successful companies with high growth potential to scale up further. Moreover, public equity markets as the exit option for growing firms are also very much smaller in the euro area than in the US (Chart A, panel a) in Box 1 of the report).
The implementation of the 2020 CMU action plan can produce some tangible progress in the development and integration of European equity markets. As detailed in Box 1, For example, the creation of a European Single Access Point (ESAP), a digital platform for harmonised company information, including sustainability-related information and open to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), as proposed by the Commission last November, can help to connect investors and companies. Moreover, the ongoing review of EU fund and insurance regulation envisages to facilitate institutional investors’ investments in green or other innovative projects. Additional measures under the Action Plan are forthcoming. The planned review of EU public listing rules should proceed swiftly to make listing easier for SMEs, including the set-up of an SME Initial Public Offering (IPO) fund. Moreover, the thorny path of making insolvency frameworks more efficient and more harmonised across member countries needs to be continued, as envisaged via a Commission proposal to be published later this year. This seems also important because of the greater indebtedness of many companies due to the COVID crisis and the possibility that currently low default rates may increase once fiscal support and public guarantees fully vanish.

Notes: The data covers data for all euro area countries excluding Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia. Venture capital is a subset of private equity and refers to equity investments made for launch (seed), early development (start-up), or expansion (later stage venture) of business. “Seed” is funding provided before the investee company has started mass production/distribution with the aim to complete research, product definition or product design, also including market tests and creating prototypes. This funding will not be used to start mass production/distribution. “Start-up” is funding provided to companies, once the product or service is fully developed, to start mass production/distribution and to cover initial marketing. Companies may be in the process of being set up or may have been in business for a shorter time but have not sold their product commercially yet. The destination of the capital would be mostly to cover capital expenditures and initial working capital. “Later stage venture” is financing provided for an operating company, which may or may not be profitable. Late stage venture tends to be financing into companies already backed by VCs. For further details see www.investeurope.eu/research/. As for “Business Angel” investment these are (high-risk) investments made by private early stage investors typically in the form of seed financing towards startup businesses. Angel investment comprises financial contribution in addition to the investment of time, expertise and connections that the investors also provide in exchange for ownership equity in the startups.
Yet further actions will be necessary to build a vibrant EU equity ecosystem, notably to support European companies with high growth potential to scale up their activities. Greater efficiency and harmonisation of equity and venture capital frameworks across Member States, including addressing the debt-equity bias in taxation, could contribute to further grow and integrate the market. It is also worthwhile to consider how large companies can be further incentivised to provide corporate venture capital to start-ups.
[

]
Moreover, the extent of the currently ongoing technological transformations, the importance of risk capital for innovation and in turn the EU’s growth and competitiveness requires commensurate engagement of both the private and the public sector and the adequate balance between the two. For example, it may justify targeted public support to stimulate private investment in promising projects. The Scale-up Europe initiative launched by the French Presidency of the EU to achieve large pan-European equity funds for late-stage company financing is targeting precisely one key bottleneck in Europe’s capital market landscape. Obviously, the success of such initiatives also depends on effective policies in other fields outside the strict financial area, such as education, business-university clusters, competition, company and labour regulations, taxation and pension reforms.
Debt issuance procedures need also to be better integrated and harmonised to reduce costs and allow investors to better diversify across EU countries. Turning to debt securities markets, there is no uniform issuance procedure at the moment. Box 3 of the report assesses to which extent home bias in debt securities holdings in the euro area could be reduced, if certain aspects of issuance processes were better integrated and therefore transaction costs reduced. The box focuses on links between Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), institutions mainly responsible for settlement and custody services and involved in the issuance process of new securities via their notary services. It finds that the existence of a link between two CSDs is associated with an economically and statistically significant reduction of home bias. It is therefore advisable to further integrate and harmonise debt issuance processes in the EU. Accordingly, the ECB supports initiatives under the September 2020 CMU action plan to reduce fragmentation in the European post-trade landscape and the SCoReE project (Single Collateral Management Rulebook for Europe).
As further domestic and cross-border bank consolidation could help address structurally low profitability and fragmentation in retail credit markets, it should be considered to remove remaining regulatory obstacles. In what concerns EU credit institutions, further consolidation could reap several benefits. With a significant cross-border dimension, it could foster the integration of credit markets, diversify revenue sources and avoid concentrations at local level. Both domestic and cross-border bank mergers have the potential to address excess capacities and cost inefficiencies, two of the factors behind structurally low profitability in Europe. Chart 2.2 suggests that consolidation has been limited since the creation of the BU in 2012, despite some moderate pick up lately (see also Chart 7, left-hand panel, in the main body). While further consolidation should remain a market-driven process and be based on credible business plans ensuring institutions’ stability, ECB Banking Supervision supports addressing remaining regulatory obstacles to cross-border consolidation. For example, consolidation through branches rather than subsidiaries could imply a deeper and more cost-effective form of consolidation, but it may presently lead to a reallocation of risk across national Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The current Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive only allows the transfer of contributions for the last 12 months before a merger from the previously responsible scheme to the new one. A more balanced approach to the allocation of resources, in line with the opinion of the European Banking Authority on the issue, would limit risk shifting between the two schemes. In previous reports, the ECB has also made suggestions for the effective use of intragroup waivers to enhance the cross-border fungibility of capital and liquidity within banking groups.

Structure and integration developments in the euro area financial system
We have recently witnessed an unprecedented shock, with non-financial corporations (NFCs) at its epicentre. The coronavirus brought a type of shock that was unprecedented in our lifetime, triggering a sharp economic downturn extraordinary in its speed, reach and scale across the world. The NFC sector was the economic epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a significant part of it was temporarily shut down or reduced in capacity. Risks then spread within the corporate sector – in the form of supply chain disruptions – and thereafter to bank and non-bank lenders. Despite its common origin, the economic and financial fallout from the crisis has been asymmetric across euro area countries: i.e. the effects on production, trade, investment, employment, consumption and financial systems have varied.
Financial structures and integration were severely stressed by the coronavirus crisis. A sequence of concerted monetary, fiscal and prudential policy responses were taken to mitigate the initial tendencies to financial fragmentation and avoid the financial sector aggravating the real-side impacts. As the period covered by this report (the last two years) coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic and financial implications of which started to materialise in Europe around mid-February 2020, particular emphasis is placed on how the ongoing crisis is influencing financial integration, structures and developments in the euro area.
The state of financial integration and the evolving structure of financial markets and intermediaries are two key elements for gauging the functioning of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). For example, they influence the extent to which asymmetric shocks can be shared and how the single monetary policy is transmitted across member countries.
This chapter is structured in two parts. The first investigates the structure of euro area financing markets and the provision of this financing by different euro area financial intermediaries. The second then focuses on measuring the extent of financial integration in the euro area, assessing the resilience of this integration and evaluating its implications for risk sharing.
1 Financial market structure
External financing of euro area NFCs and households (HHs) has held up since the onset of the pandemic (Chart 1, left-hand and middle panels, dark blue lines). It remained at levels broadly comparable with the pre-pandemic years, thanks to coordinated fiscal, monetary and prudential policy measures. NFCs and HHs financed themselves via debt instruments – loans, trade credits and debt securities – and equity instruments including listed and unlisted shares and other types of equities.
[
8
]
The timely and effective fiscal policy responses that stabilised markets and the economy came, however, at the cost of a significant increase in the financing needs of the general governments (GGs) (Chart 1, right-hand panel).
NFC external financing increased strongly at the start of the pandemic, and then slowed down from the second half of 2020. At the onset of the crisis, NFCs built precautionary liquidity buffers and front-loaded their financing needs via bank loans and debt securities,
[
9
]
as trade credit slowed down in the first half of 2020 on the back of much reduced economic activity.
[
10
]
The increase in external financing from the second half onwards was driven by improvements in trade credit and lending between NFCs, reflecting the recovery in economic activity and large firms’ liquidity support to their subsidiaries, sub-contractors and customers.
The economic contraction, combined with sharp declines in corporate sales and cash flows during the first months of the pandemic, drove up NFCs’ bank borrowing and net debt securities issuance in 2020 on the back of substantial monetary and fiscal policy support. As NFCs made a substantial effort to build up their cash buffers in 2020 and the larger ones replaced bank borrowing with market-based debt, their reliance on bank loans remained subdued in 2021. The debt increase in the euro area NFC sector was facilitated by the ECB stepping up its corporate bond purchases, as part of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). The TLTRO-III also had a positive impact on bank lending to firms.
Net issuance of listed NFC shares was negative in 2020, only returning to positive levels in 2021. At the same time net issuance of unlisted shares increased markedly. Net issuance of listed NFC shares in 2020 was strongly and negatively affected by a shift from listed equites to unlisted, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and balance sheet restructuring by multinationals. In addition to the impact of de-listing, net issuance of unlisted shares was supported by the recovery in the creation of new firms and possible recapitalisation needs of existing businesses. The renewed increase in net listed shares in 2021 was driven by robust issuance in the technology sector, moderate recapitalisations by unlisted firms and improvements in new listings.
[
11
]
Household financing flows remained at pre-pandemic levels all along. Fiscal support measures for households, high household saving ratios and continued credit growth on the back of lending for house purchases sustained household financing.
Government financing increased strongly in 2020 before the economic recovery in the latter part of 2020 and 2021, coupled with progress on the health crisis, partly reversed the drivers of this trend. The sharp contraction in economic activity in the first half of 2020 led to a sudden drop in tax revenues and a surge in current expenditures (due to automatic stabilisers and increased subsidies and transfer payments). While government consumption and investment increased from late 2020, government income also grew substantially as tax collection rose and the fiscal support measures for households put in place to mitigate the crisis declined.

Figures shown represent the sum of flows over the last four quarters at the end of Q4 for 2017 to 2020 and of Q3 for 2021.
For all sectors, the COVID-19 crisis increased the outstanding amount of total financing relative to euro area GDP. It also moderately altered the composition of the euro area economy’s balance sheet liabilities (Chart 2). The amount of total financing grew, both as a result of increased volumes and higher valuations. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, aggregate financing amounted to €73.8 trillion, or 6.1 times nominal GDP (Chart 2, middle panel).
[
12
]
The strong net issuance of debt securities since end-2019 has extended the euro area economy’s reliance on debt financing and increased the use of marketable instruments in the euro area economy’s financing mix. Debt instruments and marketable instruments increased their relative share in the financing mix by 1.1 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points respectively, mostly on account of the large government debt increase. Euro area GDP also declined considerably in 2020.

Other equity refers to equity claims that are not securities listed on an exchange and not unlisted securities, such as equity in incorporated partnerships, equity in limited liability companies whose owners are partners, capital invested in cooperative societies or investment by the government in the capital of public corporations whose capital is not divided into shares. The European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010 underlying the euro area data is broadly consistent with the SNA 2008, although in some cases it may be more detailed.
The figures for 2021 include values up to Q3, due to data availability.
An overarching lesson is that post-pandemic financing needs call for deeper and more dynamic capital markets, in particular equity markets, as well as the mobilisation of additional capital.
[
13
]
The euro area NFC sector in particular will need to re-balance debt/equity ratios to address the post-pandemic debt overhang by reallocating capital from debt to equity or mobilising additional risk capital to support growth and innovation in the euro area economy. A case in point is the depth and integration of the rapidly growing sustainable financing segment (see Box 1: Making euro area equity markets fit for green and digital innovation). Euro area economic agents will most importantly need to cater for investment efforts to meet the challenges of greening and digitising the euro area economy. At the EU level, these are estimated at €650 billion per year up to 2030.
[
14
]
This annual investment effort represents 5.4% of euro area GDP, 31.2% of combined euro area NFC, HH and GG financing and 2.3% of euro area household deposits (four quarter sum figures at the end of the third quarter of 2021).
The euro area financial sector’s capacity to attract and intermediate funds to euro area economic agents will crucially depend on scaling up market-based financing and an increasing role for the non-bank financial sector. The ECB regularly assesses these issues (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2) and tracks progress (see Box 2: Measuring market-based and non-bank financing).
Box 1
Making euro area equity markets fit for green and digital innovation
Prepared by O. Carradori, P. Molitor and H. Schölermann
Capital markets, and equity financing in particular, will be essential to meet the EU’s post-recovery ambitions. The investment required to green and digitalise the EU economy is estimated at €650 billion per year until 2030, far exceeding public recovery spending.
[
15
]
Alongside public investment programmes such as NextGenerationEU, which are expected to considerably boost innovative sectors and companies, private investment will have to be stepped up significantly over the coming years. This would help meet programme objectives and leverage the innovation and transformation potential, especially as public programmes expire.
[
16
]
From a financing perspective, research shows that equity is more suitable for riskier and innovative projects than debt.
[
17
]
Equity financing can also have a stabilising impact in an environment in which the COVID-19 crisis has increased corporate leverage substantially. Equity will thus be vital in closing the investment gap and financing post-recovery economic activity. This box provides an overview of euro area equity markets by type of equity and investor and highlights the need to further improve Europe’s equity landscape, in particular as regards risk capital.
Equity financing plays a central role in funding innovation, and is therefore a crucial complement to public investment in delivering the green and digital transition.
[
18
]
In contrast to bank lenders, equity investors are more willing to assume the greater risks associated with innovation and do not require tangible collateral.
[

]
The equity share of an economy (equity as a share of the sum of equity and credit) has been shown to positively correlate with green innovation.

Venture capital investments specifically have also been shown to spur innovation,
[
21
]
including green innovation, and there is evidence that their social return is significantly greater that of public or business R&D.
[
22
]
Accordingly, economies with a greater share of public and private equity in their financial structure have been found to de-carbonise faster than those that are more debt and bank-based.
[
23
]
At the same time, innovation is an economy-wide effort, and the extent and speed of innovation required for the green and digital transformations will also depend on public-sector initiatives and synergies between different sectors. In particular, large “mission-oriented” investment programmes induce material spillovers between the many different private and public actors involved and frequently result in innovation.
[
24
]
More generally, funding availability plays a key role throughout the R&D process, including the dissemination of new technologies; this illustrates the point that public spending on R&D and private risk capital complement each other in fostering green and digital innovation.
An enabling equity ecosystem for innovative companies includes venture capital and access to public equity markets

. While only 0.5% of US firms are backed by venture capital, these account for nearly half of all public listings.

Venture capital, especially by corporates, is also typically accompanied by significant know-how transfer. Survey data show that initial public offerings (IPOs) are a key exit strategy for firms backed by venture capital.

This not only highlights the role of venture capital, but also the importance of a diversified choice of equity instruments to help firms grow to scale and reach their full potential.

A comparison of the euro area and the US: equity financing requirements by type of equity
(ratio to nominal GDP (left-hand panel); EUR billion (right-hand panel); annual data: 2016-2020)
Sources: Panel a: ECB and OECD; panel b: European Business Angel Network, Invest Europe, National Venture Capital Association, Center for Venture Research (University of New Hampshire).
Notes: Panel a: the chart is based on financial accounts data. Other equity refers to equity claims that are not securities listed on an exchange and not unlisted securities, such as equity in incorporated partnerships, equity in limited liability companies whose owners are partners, capital invested in cooperative societies or investment by the government in the capital of public corporations whose capital is not divided into shares. Data for the US are based on the global System of National Accounts 2008. The European System of Accounts 2010 underlying the euro area data is broadly consistent with the SNA 2008, although in some cases it may be more detailed; panel b: the data cover all euro area countries except Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia. Venture capital is a subset of private equity and refers to equity investments made for launch (seed), early development (start-up), or expansion (later stage venture). “Seed” is funding provided before the investee company has started mass production/distribution, with the aim of completing research or defining and designing the product, including market testing and creating prototypes. This funding is not used to start mass production/distribution. “Start-up” is funding provided to companies once the product or service is fully developed, to start mass production/distribution and cover initial marketing. Companies may be in the process of being set up or may have been in business for a shorter time, but have not sold their product commercially yet. The use of the capital would mostly be to cover capital expenditure and initial working capital. “Later stage venture” is financing provided for an operating company, which may or may not be profitable. This tends to be financing provided to companies already backed by VCs. For further details see www.investeurope.eu/research/. “Business Angel” investments are (high-risk) investments made by early-stage private investors, typically in the form of seed financing for start-up businesses. Angel investments comprise both financial contributions and time, expertise and connections the investors provide in exchange for ownership equity.
European private equity and risk capital have grown in recent years, but the euro area still lags behind international peers. While aggregate euro area equity markets have stagnated in size over recent years, private equity has gained in relative importance compared to public equity. This is in stark contrast to the US, where listed equity plays a dominant role (see Chart A, left-hand panel). Total euro area early-stage equity financing (or risk capital) – including business angel, venture capital and growth equity investments – grew from €10.7bn in 2016 to just short of €14bn in 2020, with venture capital accounting for nearly all of the increase. Yet, despite euro area venture capital having doubled over this period, the gap with the US widened: it is now less than 5 percent of US venture capital. Similarly, total euro area risk capital is less than one-tenth of US risk capital (see Chart A, right-hand panel). The structure of venture capital financing also differs compared to the US, with most euro area venture capital funds concentrated on comparatively small, early-stage funding for companies.
[
29
]
This later-stage funding gap has been reported to lead high-growth high-potential companies (“scale-ups”) to seek funding from abroad in the pre-IPO phase; this can even lead to these companies relocating their operations.
[
30
]
US venture capital funds, for instance, are on average three times larger than their European counterparts and, in terms of capital raised between 2010 to 2019, the biggest EU venture capital firm is three times smaller than the 10th largest US venture capital firm.

Finally, there are also significant differences in the size of risk capital markets across euro area countries.
Knowledge of the main providers of equity financing to euro area NFCs can help assess the size of the equity financing gap in the euro area and identify ways to narrow it. To further shed light on the providers of equity financing to euro area non-financial corporations (NFCs), the following analysis uses 2020 Bureau van Dijk ORBIS data.
[
32
]
The sample underlying this analysis covers 8,706 euro area NFCs with 7,810 distinct ultimate owners (i.e. investors) and aggregated equity capital at book value amounting to EUR 2.7 trillion. 5,263 NFCs in the sample can be clearly assigned to the following three key economic sectors: manufacturing (40% of the sample’s equity: 2,104 entities representing 24% of the total number of entities); professional, scientific and technical activities (13% and 23% respectively); and wholesale and retail trade (4% and 13% respectively).
[
33
]
Individuals and sovereigns are the main providers of equity funding for NFCs (Chart B, left-hand panel). Individuals provide 50%, 23% and 87% of listed, unlisted and other
[
34
]
equity financing respectively. Sovereigns are the main providers of unlisted equity financing (29% of total unlisted equity) and the second largest provider of listed equity financing (24% of total listed equity). Sovereign investors – led by Italy (27% of total sovereign investment), France (23%), Germany (21%) and Austria (13%) – invest principally in large-sized companies. Financial corporations
[
35
]
(including investment companies and other financial intermediaries) supply 6% of euro area NFCs’ equity financing, with investment companies and other financial intermediaries (OFIs)
[
36
]
providing 2%. The role of OFIs reflects the provision of intra-NFC equity financing e.g. via captive finance companies. Foundations and research institutes represent 13% of total equity financing.
[
37
]
NFCs are also important providers of listed and unlisted equity financing. They see this as a way of implementing their business strategies and investing in early stage companies. Empirical evidence shows that NFCs which have benefitted from venture capital financing are more likely to provide venture capital financing to others,
[
38
]
thereby strengthening the corporate venture capital ecosystem. NFCs compete in this role with private equity funds (PEs), venture capitalists (VCs) and other early-stage risk capital providers. The methodological approach adopted for this analysis
[
39
]
underestimates the role of PEs and VCs companies for euro area NFC equity financing. VCs and PEs tend to own NFC equity via structures such as funds of funds, which are not covered in Chart B, rather than as direct portfolio positions.
[
40
]
It is chiefly large and medium-sized euro area NFCs that issue listed equity (Chart B, right-hand panel). The challenges small companies face to list on public markets include the fixed costs of listings, the lower liquidity of small stocks and the limited incentives for the advisory ecosystem to support SMEs looking to hold an IPO.

Left-hand panel: banks and other investment companies are identified within the same category of investors by Orbis.

OFIs are other financial intermediaries not classified as IBs and MFIs (broad category of monetary financial institutions and investment companies), PFs and MFs (pension funds and mutual funds), ICs (insurance corporations), PEs (private equity funds), HFs (hedge funds) or VCs (venture capital funds). Right-hand panel: the size of investees is consistent with the definition of SMEs provided by the European Commission. Medium entities have total assets of less than €43 million and the number of employees is less than or equal to 250. Small entities have total assets of less than €10 million and the number of employees is less than or equal to 50. Micro entities have total assets of less than €2 million and the number of employees is less than or equal to 10.
A pronounced home bias prevails across all types of equity financing (Chart C, left-hand panel). Equity investors from outside the euro area play a relatively more important role in providing equity financing in the form of unlisted or other equity to euro area NFCs. Looking at the residence of investors or investing firms, cross-border equity financing within the euro area is very low across all equity types and points to fragmented euro area equity markets. The strong role of individuals and the domestic public sector explain this home bias.
Excluding equity investments by individuals and sovereigns, equity is channelled from listed firms to unlisted ones (Chart C, right-hand panel). Sovereign and individuals can take stakes directly in listed equity or indirectly via investment vehicles.

The insights from this analysis suggest a need to further develop EU equity markets, especially with a view to strengthening funding opportunities for smaller, greener or innovative companies. Some measures to facilitate companies’ access to different types of funding are already under way or have been announced, in line with the European Commission’s 2020 Capital Markets Union Action Plan.
[
43
]
The recent proposal by the European Commission to create a digital platform providing free and centralised access to EU company and investment product information – the European Single Access Point (ESAP) – should make it easier for investors to identify investment opportunities and for companies to raise funding, both on private and public markets. It is especially welcome that the ESAP will include sustainability-related information, which can help gear funding toward greener activities, and be open to SMEs. Similarly, the forthcoming review of EU public listing rules by the European Commission, which will aim to make listing easier for SMEs, not least by setting up a dedicated SME IPO fund, is an opportunity to diversify smaller companies’ access to equity funding.
However, additional measures are necessary to grow the investor base and close the equity funding gap with international peers, especially in risk capital markets. Facilitating investments by institutional investors in green and innovative projects, as for instance envisaged in the ongoing review of EU fund and insurance regulation, is an important element to this effect. However, more fundamental reforms will be necessary to help Europe move closer towards its international peers as regards risk capital and cater to the needs of a highly innovative and competitive economy. More efficient and harmonised insolvency laws and regulatory frameworks for equity investments, including addressing the debt-equity bias in taxation, can improve certainty for investors, reduce costs and facilitate cross-border investments, while also making risk capital more attractive and accessible to companies.
[
44
]
Other reforms could include incentives for large companies to provide corporate venture capital for start-ups. Given the gap against international peers and the positive spillovers from cross-sectoral cooperation in innovation, there appears to be a strong case for expanding public initiatives to help catalyse risk capital investments, notably via promotional banks. Recent initiatives such as the European Innovation Council (under the EU budget) or the public-private Scale-up Europe initiative to support the creation of large pan-European equity funds for late-stage company financing provide a welcome boost. Jointly, these measures – together with an ambitious implementation of "

Citizens want universally accepted payment methods in online and physical stores across Europe
Users prefer instant and contactless person-to-person payments
High safety and security standards seen as fundamental for digital payment methods
The European Central Bank (ECB) published today the findings of its commissioned research on citizens’ payment habits and their attitudes towards digital payments in order to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences as part of the digital euro project.
Based on the responses of focus groups and online communities across all euro area countries, the report shows a strong preference for payment methods with pan-European reach and universal acceptance in physical shops and online. Users favour payment solutions that are convenient, fast and easy to use. Participants valued the possibility of instant and contactless person-to-person payments, regardless of the platform or device. Focus group respondents also wished for a one-stop-solution that would incorporate all the current payment options into one system.
Safety and security were a concern among respondents, who sought guarantees against fraud and hacking, as well as secure and reliable payment authentication methods. Biometric methods of payment verification, such as those involving iris scan technology, were widely supported by participants, while flexible and adjustable privacy settings were seen as desirable.
“We want the digital euro to add value for end users and merit their confidence,” says ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta, Chair of the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “A digital euro could enhance European payments by providing a universally accepted and secure solution that facilitates contactless and instant payments.”
Participants demonstrated little knowledge of the digital euro, but they generally agreed that banks and/or central banks would be the safest and most reliable providers. They also expressed the view that a digital euro should not undermine cash.
These findings will feed into the ongoing digital euro investigation phase, which is expected to conclude in October 2023.
Conducted from October 2021 to December 2021, this qualitative research gathered contributions from: (i) members of the general public, (ii) people with knowledge of technology, (iii) small and micro merchants and retailers, and (iv) individuals with limited access to banking services or the internet.

,"Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 30 March 2022
Thank you for inviting me to update you on the digital euro project and the progress made since we last met in November.
We have previously discussed the broad policy objectives associated with a digital euro.
[
1
]
Today, I would first like to highlight some important features which, by making a digital euro attractive to citizens and merchants alike, would help us to achieve these objectives.
I will do so by discussing the findings of the focus groups we held – which we are publishing today on the occasion of this hearing
[
2
]
– and our analysis of “use cases” for the digital euro. In the jargon of payments, this term refers to the payment segments that a digital euro could serve.
I will then present our preliminary findings on how to reconcile the right to confidentiality with the public interest in countering illegal activities, continuing the discussion we had a year ago.
[

Meeting the payment needs of Europeans today and tomorrow
The primary aim of a digital euro is to maintain the accessibility and usability of central bank money in an increasingly digitalised economy. But for a digital euro to fulfil this role, people need to be able and willing to use it.
From the outset, I have stressed that a digital euro can only be successful if it meets the payment needs of Europeans today and in the future.
The findings of our focus groups provide valuable input here, though we are mindful of the natural limitations of qualitative analyses of this kind.
[
4
]
The focus groups suggested that people see the ability to “pay anywhere” as the most important feature of a new digital payment instrument. This emerged in all countries and age groups. It means that, ideally, all merchants across the euro area – both in physical stores and online – would need to accept a digital euro. 20 years ago, the introduction of euro banknotes made it possible for us to pay with physical euros anywhere in the euro area. So it is no surprise that people expect to be able to use the digital complement to banknotes wherever they can pay digitally or online.
Instant, easy, contactless payments, especially for person-to-person payments, were the second-most valued feature. Cash has so far remained dominant in person-to-person payments. And we will ensure that people continue to have access to cash. But the focus groups confirm previous findings: preferences are shifting towards digital payments.
[
5
]
The experience of countries both inside
[
6
]
and outside
[
7
]
the euro area shows that contactless person-to-person payments may grow very rapidly when convenient digital solutions become available.
Participants in the focus groups would like to see a solution that would allow instant person-to-person payments regardless of the platform used by the payers and payees. Today, making mobile payments to friends at the click of a button – for example when splitting bills in restaurants or collecting money for a gift – is often easiest when everyone is using the same app. Participants therefore envisaged a one-stop solution that would reduce the need for multiple cards, devices and identification methods and give them access to a range of payment options on a single device.
Our focus groups also confirmed what I called “rational inattention” during our exchange in November.
[
8
]
People tend not to pay attention to – or understand – the difference between the digital euro and the euros they already spend using private digital means of payment. For the financial system to work smoothly, public money and commercial bank money are meant to be fully interchangeable yet distinguishable. People do not think twice about storing and using their money via private intermediaries because they know they can regularly go to the cash machine and withdraw banknotes without any problems. This provides tangible proof that their money in the bank is safe. Convertibility with central bank money on a one-to-one basis therefore anchors people’s confidence in private money, supporting its wide acceptance.
[
9
]
The findings from focus groups were also used to validate our selection of possible use cases of a digital euro.
[
10
]
We identified them by looking both at our policy objectives and at the importance of different market segments.
Physical stores are the most important market segment for digital payments, accounting for more than 40 billion transactions in the euro area in 2019.
[
11
]
E-commerce payments are less numerous but are expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years.
[
12
]
These segments are served by a multitude of payment solutions, often with only domestic reach. So far, they have been dominated by non-European providers and technologies.
[
13
]
Given their importance now and in the future, payments in e-commerce and physical stores, as well as person-to-person payments, are natural candidates to be prioritised among the possible use cases of a digital euro. The digital euro could also be used for payments between governments and individuals, for example to pay out public welfare allowances or to pay taxes.
[
14
]
If a digital euro offered these payment options, we would achieve network effects, continue to ensure public access and full usability of central bank money for digital payments, and help to address sovereignty concerns. In the next steps of our investigation phase, we will therefore focus on assessing the actual feasibility of these use cases.
But we will leave the door open to the inclusion of other use cases in the future. We are monitoring emerging trends such as machine-to-machine payments.
[
15
]
And we are looking into solutions to respond to these trends in future releases of a digital euro.
[
16
]
In the coming months, and building on the findings of the focus groups, we will carefully investigate how to design an attractive digital euro product that responds to the expectations of payers and payees alike.
Co-legislators have a key role to play. For instance, the ability to pay with digital euro anywhere could be fostered by giving it legal tender status. We are thoroughly and carefully analysing this issue together with the European Commission. We stand ready to discuss the matter further with you, also on the basis of the outcome of the upcoming consultation on digital euro the Commission has recently announced.
The trade-offs between privacy and other EU policy objectives
The legal framework will also be key when it comes to privacy, which is one of the most important design features of a digital euro.
[
17
]
The public consultation we conducted between October 2020 and January 2021 indicated that protecting privacy is key, so that the digital euro helps to maintain trust in payments in the digital age.
[
18
]
Focus group participants also said they would appreciate options that give them control over their personal data.
It is not surprising that people expect payments in digital euro to guarantee high privacy standards. As payments go digital, private companies are increasingly monetising payment data.
We already provide cash, the payment instrument with the highest level of privacy. We are committed, as a public institution, to retain people’s trust in this area if a digital euro is issued.
At the same time, we need to assess privacy in the context of other EU policy objectives, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). Concerns about regulations being circumvented, including to bypass international sanctions, have become even more prominent recently, notably in relation to crypto-assets.
Over the past few months we have investigated various options to address the trade-off between retaining a high degree of privacy and other important public policy objectives.
[
19
]
Full anonymity is not a viable option from a public policy perspective. It would raise concerns about the digital euro potentially being used for illicit purposes.
[
20
]
In addition, it would make it virtually impossible to limit the use of the digital euro as a form of investment, but this limitation is essential from a financial stability perspective.
[
21
]
This means that users would need to identify themselves when they start using the digital euro.
[
22
]
Supervised intermediaries – which are the natural candidates for distributing a digital euro – are best placed to manage this onboarding process.
[
23
]
Moving beyond onboarding, our analysis suggests that digital euro transaction data should not be visible to the Eurosystem – or any other central entity – beyond what is strictly needed to perform its functions.
[
24
]
In a baseline scenario, a digital euro would provide people with a level of privacy equal to or higher than that of private digital solutions. Under this set-up, personal and transaction data
[
25
]
would only be accessible to intermediaries to ensure compliance with AML/CFT requirements and relevant provisions under EU law.
[
26
]
We have also been exploring options to go beyond this baseline and provide greater privacy, should the co-legislators decide in favour of this approach. This could allow the digital euro to replicate some cash-like features and enable greater privacy for lower-value payments, which are usually low risk in terms of money laundering, terrorism financing and violations of relevant EU law.
Consider paying “offline” in digital euro in a shop, with payer and payee in close proximity to each other. This would be very similar to making a cash payment. Should different standards apply for these two payments, even if the risk profiles are similar? Take the example of a chip that can store up to €200 in digital euro – the risk that it is used for money laundering purposes hardly seems higher than for a physical €200 banknote, especially if the chip requires biometric authentication before you can use it.
We are therefore exploring an offline functionality whereby holdings, balances and transaction amounts would not be known to anyone but the user. To contain the risks, these balances and private offline payments would have an upper limit.
In general, a greater degree of privacy could be considered for lower-value online and offline payments. These payments could be subject to simplified AML/CFT checks, while higher-value transactions would remain subject to the standard controls.
[
27
]
If greater privacy were to be enabled for lower-value payments in digital euro, it should apply to transactions anywhere in the euro area. This would require a harmonised framework for simplified checks, as foreseen in the European Commission’s AML/CFT package from July 2021.
[
28
]
The Eurosystem High-Level Task Force that I chair is exploring the technical and regulatory aspects, in close cooperation with the European Commission and the European data protection authorities.
[
29
]
But there are important political choices to be made, which makes our dialogue with you crucial.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
We are building a broad consensus around the policy objectives for a digital euro through our interactions with stakeholders, political authorities and other major central banks. But just recognising the political need for a digital euro will not by itself guarantee sufficient usage.
Step by step, we are getting a clearer picture of what citizens and merchants want, so we can finetune all the design features of a digital euro before any potential issuance. And co-legislators have a key role to play, for instance to enable greater privacy.
We do not want to be “too successful” and crowd out private payment solutions and financial intermediation. But the digital euro should be “successful enough” and generate sufficient demand by adding value for users.
We already have an idea of the views of the prospective users of a digital euro thanks to our discussions with focus groups. Towards the end of the year we will conduct another round of focus groups, this time giving participants a better idea of the envisaged user experience to gather their feedback.
We will also step up our dialogue with stakeholders in the coming weeks and months, listening to prospective users like consumer groups, small and medium-sized enterprises, retailers and large corporations, as well as to banks and payment service providers. We will also continue to interact with academia and think tanks.
We stand ready to discuss these consultations with you at future hearings. The alignment of European authorities and institutions, mindful of their respective mandates and independence, will be key if a digital euro is to be accepted.
I now look forward to our discussion."

ECB and Narodowy Bank Polski set up new €10 billion swap line until 15 January 2023
ECB extends existing temporary repo lines with non-euro area central banks to 15 January 2023 following central banks’ extension requests
Euro liquidity lines address possible liquidity needs in non-euro area countries given uncertainty from Russian invasion of Ukraine and regional spillover risk, while having full regard to EU sanctions
The European Central Bank (ECB) and Narodowy Bank Polski have agreed to set up a precautionary swap line to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions in Poland.
The ECB has also decided to extend its temporary bilateral repo lines to the central banks of Hungary, Albania, the Republic of North Macedonia and the Republic of San Marino. The size of the individual agreements will remain unchanged. These bilateral lines were established in 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions in those countries via their central banks. The lines were due to expire at the end of March 2022, as they were specifically aimed at addressing possible euro liquidity needs in the presence of market dysfunctions due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Following requests from the central banks and based on a positive case-by-case assessment by the Governing Council, these swap and repo lines have been granted until 15 January 2023. In the context of heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the lines are designed to prevent spillover effects in euro area financial markets and economies that might adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. At the same time, full regard has been given to the applicable EU sanctions, with which the ECB expects its counterparties to comply, so that the lines are not used to circumvent the sanctions.
Temporary agreements complement the ECB’s standing swap lines and EUREP repo agreements. The EUREP facility was extended to 15 January 2023 as part of ECB’s monetary policy decisions of 10 March 2022.
Under the new swap line, Narodowy Bank Polski will be able to borrow up to €10 billion from the ECB in exchange for Polish zloty.
Under their respective repo line agreements:
The Magyar Nemzeti Bank can borrow up to €4 billion from the ECB
Banka e Shqipërisë (Bank of Albania) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB
??????? ????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?????????? (National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB
Banca Centrale della Repubblica di San Marino (Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino) can borrow up to €100 million from the ECB
Under a repo line, a national central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral.

Pandemic collateral easing measures introduced in April 2020 will be gradually phased out in three steps between July 2022 and March 2024
Step-wise phasing out of measures will gradually restore Eurosystem’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance and avoid collateral availability cliff effects
ECB will continue to waive minimum credit quality requirement for GGBs, allowing NCBs to accept them as collateral in line with continued eligibility in PEPP
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to gradually phase out the package of pandemic collateral easing measures in place since April 2020. The Governing Council has taken into account in a forward-looking manner the impact of this gradual phasing out on the collateral availability of Eurosystem counterparties, in particular with regard to their ability to continue mobilising collateral until the maturity of the outstanding targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Moreover, it has considered the risk impact of each of these measures. This gradual phasing out allows ample time for the Eurosystem’s counterparties to adapt, and is scheduled to take place in the following three steps.
Step 1 From 8 July 2022 the ECB will implement a set of decisions. First, it will halve the temporary reduction in collateral valuation haircuts across all assets from the current 20% adjustment to 10%. Second, the ECB will no longer maintain the eligibility of marketable assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 but whose credit ratings subsequently deteriorated below the minimum rating threshold. Third, the ECB will restore the limit with respect to unsecured debt instruments issued by any single other banking group in a credit institution’s collateral pool from 10% to 2.5%, as was the case before April 2020. Fourth, the ECB will phase out the temporary easing of certain technical requirements for the eligibility of additional credit claims (ACC), mainly relating to fully restoring the frequency of the ACC loan level reporting requirements and the acceptance requirements for banks’ own credit assessments from internal rating-based systems. The relevant national central banks will communicate the details to the affected counterparties.
Step 2 In June 2023 the ECB expects to implement a new valuation haircut schedule based on its pre-pandemic risk tolerance level for credit operations, phasing out the remaining general 10% reduction in collateral valuation haircuts. Details of the new haircut schedule will be announced in due course and will take into account the results of the forthcoming regular review of the ECB risk control framework.
Step 3 In March 2024 the ECB will in principle phase out the remaining pandemic collateral easing measures, following a comprehensive review of the ACC frameworks that will take into account counterparties’ collateral needs for their continued participation in the outstanding TLTRO III operations until December 2024. These measures include the acceptance of various ACCs introduced during the pandemic period, such as loans guaranteed by the government and certain public sector entities.
Notwithstanding this, national central banks may decide to terminate (parts of) their ACC framework early.
The Governing Council has decided to continue to allow NCBs to accept as eligible collateral Greek government bonds (GGBs) that do not satisfy the Eurosystem’s minimum credit quality requirements but fulfil all other applicable eligibility criteria, for at least as long as reinvestments in GGBs under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) continue.

The ECB’s Governing Council reserves the right to deviate also in the future from credit rating agencies’ ratings if warranted, in line with its discretion under the monetary policy framework, thereby avoiding mechanistic reliance on these ratings.
The ECB’s Governing Council adopted the underlying package of temporary collateral easing measures in April 2020 as part of its policy response to the pandemic, to facilitate the availability of eligible collateral for Eurosystem counterparties and to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades resulting from the economic fallout from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a watershed for Europe. The Governing Council expresses its full support to the people of Ukraine. It will ensure smooth liquidity conditions and implement the sanctions decided by the European Union and European governments. The Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to safeguard financial stability.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Based on its updated assessment and taking into account the uncertain environment, the Governing Council today revised the purchase schedule for its APP for the coming months. Monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect its evolving assessment of the outlook. If the incoming data support the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even after the end of its net asset purchases, the Governing Council will conclude net purchases under the APP in the third quarter. If the medium-term inflation outlook changes and if financing conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards the 2% target, the Governing Council stands ready to revise its schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of the Governing Council’s net purchases under the APP and will be gradual. The path for the key ECB interest rates will continue to be determined by the Governing Council’s forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
In the first quarter of 2022, the Governing Council is conducting net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. It will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
Liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks
In view of the highly uncertain environment caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the risk of regional spillovers that could adversely affect euro area financial markets, the Governing Council decided to extend the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) until 15 January 2023. EUREP will therefore continue to complement the regular euro liquidity-providing arrangements for non-euro area central banks. Together, these form a comprehensive set of backstop facilities to address possible euro liquidity needs in the event of market dysfunctions outside the euro area that could adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. Requests from non-euro area central banks for individual euro liquidity lines will be assessed by the Governing Council on a case-by-case basis.

The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term.

Financing conditions in securities financing markets continued to ease for most collateral types, but credit conditions in OTC derivatives markets tightened
Market-making activities had decreased for both debt securities and derivatives over the past year but were expected to broadly increase in 2022
Market participants expressed very low confidence in their ability to act as market-makers for corporate bonds in times of stress
As for securities financing transactions, survey participants reported a continued easing of financing conditions. This overall tendency could be seen in the net percentages reporting slightly higher or unchanged maximum amounts, the maximum maturity of funding for most types of euro-denominated collateral, and in decreasing rates/spreads for funding against most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral had increased slightly or were unchanged for almost all types of collateral. Respondents also reported weaker demand for funding for most collateral types.
Turning to non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, respondents reported that initial margin requirements had increased slightly for many types of OTC derivative, and that liquidity and trading had deteriorated for many OTC derivative types.
The overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened slightly over the period from September to November 2021. A small net percentage of respondents reported less favourable overall credit terms for all counterparty types. While price terms tightened across the board, non-price terms tightened only for insurance companies and non-financial corporations. The overall tightening continues the development reported in previous quarters but contrasts with the expectations expressed in the last survey. Looking ahead, a small net percentage of respondents to the December survey expected a further tightening of price terms for all types of counterparty over the period from December 2021 to February 2022, while non-price terms were expected to ease for most types of counterparty.
The December 2021 survey included a number of special questions about market-making activities. Survey respondents reported that market-making activities had decreased for many types of debt security and derivative over the past year, but were expected to broadly increase in 2022. Respondents cited competition from other banks as the main driver of changes in market-making activities over the last year and willingness to take on risk as the main driver of expected changes in market-making activities in the year ahead. Respondents expressed confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for many asset classes – broadly confirming their assessment of the past two years – with the important exception of corporate bonds, for which they expressed very low confidence. Compared with the December 2020 survey, more respondents reported a “very limited” or “limited” ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for the categories “other government bonds” (i.e. lower quality government bonds) and “high-yield corporate bonds”.
The December 2021 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the ECB’s website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The December 2021 survey collected qualitative information on changes between September and November 2021. The results are based on responses from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

ECB profit €0.2 billion (2020: €1.6 billion) after €0.6 billion transfer to provision for financial risks
Profit distributed to euro area national central banks
Net interest income on securities held for monetary policy purposes €1.0 billion (2020: €1.3 billion)
ECB’s Balance Sheet grows to €680 billion (2020: €569 billion)
The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) audited financial statements for 2021 show that profit for the year was €192 million (2020: €1,643 million). The €1,452 million decrease compared to the previous year was mainly due to lower income from foreign reserve assets and from securities held for monetary policy purposes, as well as a transfer to the provision for financial risks. The Governing Council decided to transfer €610 million to the provision for financial risks in response to higher risk exposure stemming mainly from the continued purchases of monetary policy securities.
Net interest income totalled €1,566 million in 2021 (2020: €2,017 million). Net interest income on foreign reserve assets decreased to €197 million (2020: €474 million) owing to lower interest income earned on the US dollar portfolio. Net interest income arising from securities held for monetary policy purposes decreased to €1,006 million (2020: €1,337 million), mainly owing to negative interest income from the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).
Write-downs amounted to €133 million (2020: €26 million), mainly stemming from unrealised price losses on securities held in the US dollar and own funds portfolios.
Impairment tests are conducted on the securities held by the ECB in its monetary policy portfolios, which are valued at amortised cost (subject to impairment). Based on the results of these tests, no impairment losses have been recorded for these portfolios.
Total staff costs increased to €674 million (2020: €646 million) as a result of higher costs relating to post-employment benefits arising from the annual actuarial valuation and the higher average number of staff. Other administrative expenses increased to €564 million (2020: €553 million), mainly owing to an increase in property maintenance expenses.
Supervisory fee income, derived from fees charged to recover expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its supervisory tasks, amounted to €578 million (2020: €535 million). The increase in 2021 was driven by the continuing development of banking supervision-related IT systems and higher staff costs.
The ECB’s profit is distributed to the euro area national central banks (NCBs). The Governing Council decided to make an interim profit distribution of €150 million on 31 January 2022. At yesterday’s meeting, the Governing Council decided to distribute the remainder of the profit, amounting to €42 million, on 18 February 2022.
The total size of the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €111 billion to €680 billion (2020: €569 billion). This increase was mainly due to securities purchased under the PEPP and the asset purchase programme (APP).
At the end of 2021 the size of the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem, which comprises assets and liabilities of the euro area NCBs and of the ECB vis-à-vis third parties, stood at €8,566 billion (2020: €6,978 billion). The growth compared to the previous year was mainly due to securities purchased under the PEPP and the APP and the increase in Eurosystem refinancing operations as a result of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III).
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes rose by €1,019 billion to €4,713 billion (2020: €3,694 billion). The APP holdings increased by €214 billion to €3,123 billion and the PEPP holdings increased by €827 billion to €1,581 billion.

1.1 Purpose of the ECB’s management report
The management report
[

]
is an integral part of the ECB’s Annual Accounts and is designed to provide readers with contextual information related to the financial statements.
[
2
]
Given that the ECB’s activities and operations are undertaken in support of its policy objectives, the ECB’s financial position and result should be viewed in conjunction with its policy actions.
To this end, the management report presents the ECB’s main tasks and activities, as well as their impact on its financial statements. Furthermore, it analyses the main developments in the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account during the year and includes information on the ECB’s financial resources. Finally, it describes the risk environment in which the ECB operates, providing information on the specific risks to which the ECB is exposed, and the risk management policies used to mitigate risks.
1.2 Main tasks and activities
The ECB is part of the Eurosystem, which comprises, besides the ECB, the 19 national central banks (NCBs) of the Member States of the European Union (EU) whose currency is the euro. The Eurosystem has the primary objective of maintaining price stability.
[

1.3 Financial developments
1.3.1 Balance Sheet
In the period from 2017 to 2021, developments in the ECB’s Balance Sheet were mainly driven by outright purchases of securities by the ECB as part of the implementation of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem (Chart 1). The ECB’s Balance Sheet expanded in 2018, mainly owing to the net acquisition of securities under the asset purchase programme (APP)
[
6
]
. Net purchases under this programme ceased in December 2018 and resumed again in November 2019. As a result, the ECB’s Balance Sheet grew more slowly in 2019, and most of this growth stemmed from rises in the market value of the ECB’s foreign reserve assets and in the value of euro banknotes in circulation. In 2020, in order to address the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Governing Council decided on a comprehensive package of monetary policy measures, including the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
[
7
]
, leading to further balance sheet growth. Net purchases under the APP and the PEPP continued in 2021, increasing still further the size of the ECB’s Balance Sheet.
In 2021 the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €110.8 billion to €680.1 billion, mainly owing to the ECB’s share of securities purchases under the PEPP and the APP. These purchases resulted in an increase in securities held for monetary policy purposes, while the cash settlement of these purchases via TARGET2 accounts led to a corresponding increase in intra-Eurosystem liabilities. This increase in intra-Eurosystem liabilities was more than offset by the cash received from the ECB’s non-euro area TARGET2 customers, which also resulted in an increase in other liabilities.
In addition, the rises in the value of euro banknotes in circulation and in the market value of the ECB’s foreign reserve assets also contributed to the growth of the ECB’s Balance Sheet.
Chart 1
Main components of the ECB’s Balance Sheet
(EUR billions)
Source: ECB.
Euro-denominated securities held for monetary policy purposes made up 65% of the ECB’s total assets at the end of 2021. Under this balance sheet item, the ECB holds securities acquired in the context of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the three covered bond purchase programmes (CBPP1, CBPP2 and CBPP3), the ABSPP, the PSPP and the PEPP.
In 2021 the ECB, based on the relevant Governing Council decisions, continued its net purchases of securities under the APP and the PEPP, including the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under these programmes. As a result of these purchases, the portfolio of securities held by the ECB for monetary policy purposes increased by €96.4 billion to €445.4 billion (Chart 2), with PEPP purchases accounting for most of this increase. The €1.3 billion decrease in holdings under the SMP, CBPP1 and CBPP2 was due to redemptions.
In December 2021 the Governing Council announced
[
8
]
that it would increase net purchases under the APP to a monthly pace of €40 billion in the second quarter and €30 billion in the third quarter of 2022. From October 2022 onwards, net asset purchases will be maintained at a monthly pace of €20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ECB’s policy rates, and will end shortly before the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council also decided to discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022, but they could be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic. The Eurosystem will continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP and the PEPP in line with the Governing Council decision.

In 2021 the total euro equivalent value of the ECB’s foreign reserve assets, which consist of gold, special drawing rights, US dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi, increased by €4.5 billion to €80.3 billion.
The euro equivalent value of the ECB’s holdings of gold and gold receivables increased by €1.1 billion to €26.1 billion in 2021 (Chart 4) owing to an increase in the market price of gold in euro terms, while the size of these holdings in fine ounces remained unchanged. This increase also led to an equivalent rise in the ECB’s gold revaluation accounts (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”).

The ECB’s foreign currency holdings
[
10
]
of US dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi increased in euro terms by €2.9 billion to €53.0 billion (Chart 5), mainly owing to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro. The appreciation of the US dollar is also reflected in higher balances in the ECB’s revaluation accounts (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”).
Chart 5
Foreign currency holdings
(EUR billions)

The US dollar continued to be the main component of the ECB’s foreign currency holdings, accounting for approximately 77% of the total at the end of 2021.
The ECB manages the investment of its foreign currency holdings using a three-step approach. First, a strategic benchmark portfolio is designed by the ECB’s risk managers and approved by the Governing Council. Second, the ECB’s portfolio managers design the tactical benchmark portfolio, which is approved by the Executive Board. Third, investment operations are conducted in a decentralised manner by the NCBs on a day-to-day basis.
The ECB’s foreign currency holdings are mainly invested in securities and money market deposits or are held in current accounts (Chart 6). Securities in this portfolio are valued at year-end market prices.
Chart 6
Composition of foreign currency investments
(EUR billions)

The purpose of the ECB’s foreign currency holdings is to finance potential interventions in the foreign exchange market. For this reason, the ECB’s foreign currency holdings are managed in accordance with three objectives (in order of priority): liquidity, safety and return. Therefore, this portfolio mainly comprises securities with short maturities (Chart 7).
Chart 7
Maturity profile of foreign currency-denominated securities
Source: ECB.
In 2021 the value of the own funds portfolio increased by €0.4 billion to €21.1 billion (Chart 8), mainly owing to the investment of the amounts paid up by the euro area NCBs in 2021 in respect of the first instalment of their increased subscriptions in the ECB’s capital following the withdrawal of the Bank of England from the ESCB (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”). This increase was partially offset, mainly by the decline in the market value of the securities held in the own funds portfolio.
The portfolio mainly consists of euro-denominated securities which are valued at year-end market prices. In 2021 government debt securities accounted for 72% of the total portfolio.
In 2021 the ECB decided to use part of its own funds portfolio to invest in the euro-denominated green bond investment fund for central banks (EUR BISIP G2) launched by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in January 2021. This investment complements direct purchases of green bonds in secondary markets. The share of the green investments in the own funds portfolio continued to increase steadily from 3.5% at the end of 2020 to 7.6% at the end of 2021. The ECB plans to further increase this share over the coming years.
Chart 8
The ECB’s own funds portfolio
(EUR billions)
Source: ECB.
The ECB’s own funds portfolio predominantly consists of investments of the ECB’s financial resources, namely its paid-up capital and amounts held in the general reserve fund and the provision for financial risks. Owing to the reinvestment of income proceeds and the valuation of securities at market prices, the own funds portfolio and the aforementioned financial resources do not necessarily correspond in size. The purpose of this portfolio is to provide income to help fund the ECB’s operating expenses which are not related to the delivery of its supervisory tasks.
[
11
]
It is invested in euro-denominated assets, subject to the limits imposed by its risk control framework. This results in a more diversified maturity structure (Chart 9) than in the foreign reserves portfolio.

Maturity profile of the ECB’s own funds securities

At the end of 2021, the total value of euro banknotes in circulation was €1,544.4 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the end of 2020. The ECB has been allocated an 8% share of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, which amounted to €123.6 billion at the end of the year. Since the ECB does not issue banknotes itself, it holds intra-Eurosystem claims vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs for a value equivalent to the value of the banknotes in circulation.
The ECB’s intra-Eurosystem liabilities, which mainly comprise the net TARGET2 balance of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB and the ECB’s liabilities with regard to the foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the euro area NCBs when they joined the Eurosystem, decreased by €3.3 billion to €375.1 billion in 2021. The development of the intra-Eurosystem liabilities over the period from 2017 to 2020, was mostly driven by the evolution of the net TARGET2 liability as a result of the ECB’s net purchases of securities held for monetary policy purposes, which are settled via TARGET2 accounts (Chart 10).
In 2021, the impact of monetary policy securities purchases on the net TARGET2 liability was more than offset, mainly by the higher deposits of the ECB’s non-euro area TARGET2 customers and non-euro area residents accepted by the ECB in its role as fiscal agent and by the increase in cash received as collateral from security lending operations.

1.3.2 Financial resources
The ECB’s financial resources consist of its capital, the provision for financial risks, the revaluation accounts and the profit for the year. These financial resources are (i) invested in assets that generate income and/or (ii) used to directly offset losses materialising from financial risks. As at 31 December 2021, the ECB’s financial resources totalled €49.7 billion (Chart 11). This was €3.5 billion higher than in 2020 owing to increases in (i) the revaluation accounts following the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro as well as the rise in the market price of gold in euro terms in 2021, (ii) the paid-up capital and (iii) the provision for financial risks
[

. These increases more than offset the lower profit in 2021 compared to 2020.

Note: “Revaluation accounts” includes total revaluation gains on gold, foreign currency and securities holdings, but excludes the revaluation account for post-employment benefits.
Unrealised gains on gold, foreign currencies and securities that are subject to price revaluation are not recognised as income in the Profit and Loss Account but are recorded directly in revaluation accounts shown on the liability side of the ECB’s Balance Sheet. The balances in these accounts can be used to absorb the impact of any future unfavourable movement in the respective prices and/or exchange rates, and thus strengthen the ECB’s resilience against the underlying risks. In 2021 the revaluation accounts for gold, foreign currencies and securities
[
13
]
increased by €3.8 billion to €33.1 billion owing to higher revaluation balances for foreign currencies and gold, mainly as a result of the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro (Chart 12) and the rise in the market price of gold in euro terms, which were partially offset by the decrease in the revaluation balances for securities.

Following the Bank of England’s departure from the ESCB in 2020, the shares of the remaining NCBs in the subscribed capital of the ECB increased. The Governing Council decided that the remaining NCBs would cover only the Bank of England’s withdrawn paid-up capital of €58 million in 2020 and that the euro area NCBs would pay up in full their increased subscriptions in two equal annual instalments in 2021 and 2022. Following the payment of the first instalment by the euro area NCBs, the ECB’s paid-up capital increased by €0.6 billion to €8.3 billion in 2021. It will increase by a further €0.6 billion to €8.9 billion in 2022.

In view of its exposure to financial risks (see Section 1.4.1 “Financial risks”), the ECB maintains a provision for financial risks. The size of this provision is reviewed annually, taking a range of factors into account, including the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the projected results for the coming year and a risk assessment. The provision for financial risks, together with any amount held in the ECB’s general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.
As a result of the €0.6 billion increase in the ECB’s paid-up capital in 2021, the upper limit of the provision for financial risks increased by an equal amount. Taking into account the results of the assessment of the ECB’s exposures to financial risks, the Governing Council decided to transfer €0.6 billion to the ECB’s provision for financial risks, increasing it to its maximum permitted level of €8.2 billion.
The profit resulting from the ECB’s assets and liabilities in a given financial year can be used to absorb potential losses incurred in the same year. In 2021 the ECB’s profit, after the transfer to the provision for financial risks, was €0.2 billion (see Section 1.3.3 “Profit and Loss Account”).
1.3.3 Profit and Loss Account
The ECB’s annual profit reached a peak in 2019 after several years of increases, mainly owing to rising interest income generated on securities held for monetary policy purposes and on foreign reserve assets. In 2020 the ECB’s profit started to decrease, predominantly due to lower income on the aforementioned items.
In 2021 the ECB’s profit was €192 million (2020: €1,643 million). The decrease of €1,452 million compared with 2020 was mainly driven by a lower net result of financial operations, write-downs and risk provisions, in particular due to the transfer to the provision for financial risks, and lower net interest income (Chart 13).

The net interest income of the ECB decreased by €451 million to €1,566 million (Chart 14) owing to lower interest income earned on securities held for monetary policy purposes and on foreign reserve assets. The increase in net other interest income only partially compensated for these decreases.

Net interest income

Net interest income generated on securities held for monetary policy purposes decreased by €331 million to €1,006 million in 2021 (Chart 15) mainly owing to negative net interest income on the PEPP portfolio. The continuation of public sector securities purchases under the PEPP – at a negative average yield as a result of the low euro area sovereign bond yields prevailing during the implementation of this programme (Chart 16) – led to increased negative net interest income of €252 million on this portfolio in 2021, compared to negative net interest income of €41 million the year before. In addition, net interest income on the SMP, CBPP1 and CBPP2 portfolios decreased by €82 million to €111 million owing to the decline in the size of these portfolios as a result of maturing securities. Finally, net interest income arising from the APP (from securities held under the ABSPP, CBPP3 and PSPP) decreased by €37 million to €1,147 million, mainly owing to a lower average interest rate earned on securities held under the ABSPP.
In 2021 securities held for monetary policy purposes generated 64% of the ECB’s net interest income.

Net interest income on foreign reserve assets decreased by €277 million to €197 million, mainly as a result of lower interest income earned on securities denominated in US dollars. Owing to the low US dollar bond yields throughout most of 2020 and 2021 (Chart 17), and sales and redemptions of higher yield bonds purchased in the past, the average interest rate earned on the ECB’s US dollar portfolio further decreased in 2021 compared to the previous year.

Both the interest income on the ECB’s share of total euro banknotes in circulation and the interest expense related to the remuneration of NCBs’ claims in respect of foreign reserves transferred were zero as a result of the 0% interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its main refinancing operations (MROs) in 2021.
Net other interest income increased, mainly owing to higher interest income on (i) the accounts held at the ECB by the ECB’s non-euro area TARGET2 customers, (ii) monetary policy security lending operations and (iii) deposits accepted by the ECB in its role as fiscal agent, each as a result of the higher average balances in 2021. These increases more than compensated for the lower interest income earned on the own funds portfolio as a result of the low-yield environment in the euro area (Chart 16).
The net result of financial operations and write-downs on financial assets amounted to a loss of €139 million in 2021, compared to a gain of €316 million in 2020 (Chart 18). The main drivers of this were net realised price losses in 2021, compared to net realised price gains in 2020, and higher write-downs on US dollar and euro-denominated securities.
The net realised price losses stemmed from euro-denominated securities and US dollar-denominated interest rate futures. These losses were only partially offset by realised price gains on US dollar-denominated securities, which were still positive in 2021 but lower than the previous year, as US dollar bond yields remained stable throughout most of 2020 and 2021 before starting to rise towards the end of 2021.

In addition, as at 31 December 2021, €610 million was transferred to the ECB’s provision for financial risks, reducing the ECB’s profit by an equal amount. After taking the results of its risk assessment into account, the Governing Council decided to increase the size of the provision for financial risks to €8,194 million, which is its upper limit as determined by the paid-up capital of the euro area NCBs (see Section 1.3.2 “Financial resources”).
The total operating expenses of the ECB, including depreciation and banknote production services, increased by €39 million to €1,238 million (Chart 19). The increase compared to 2020 was mainly due to higher staff costs resulting from (i) higher costs in relation to post-employment benefits as a result of a higher current service cost following the annual actuarial valuation and (ii) the higher average number of staff in 2021. Administrative expenses increased slightly, mainly owing to higher property maintenance expenses.
Banking supervision-related expenses are fully covered by fees levied on the supervised entities. Based on the actual expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its banking supervision tasks, supervisory fee income for 2021 stood at €578 million.

1.4 Risk management
Risk management is a critical part of the ECB’s activities and is conducted through a continuous process of (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) review of the risk strategy and policies, (iii) implementation of risk mitigating actions, and (iv) risk monitoring and reporting, all of which are supported by effective methodologies, processes and systems.
Figure 2
Risk management cycle
The following sections focus on the risks, their sources, and the applicable risk control frameworks.
1.4.1 Financial risks
The Executive Board proposes policies and procedures that ensure an appropriate level of protection against the financial risks to which the ECB is exposed. The Risk Management Committee (RMC), which comprises experts from Eurosystem central banks, contributes to the monitoring, measuring and reporting of financial risks related to the balance sheet of the Eurosystem, and it defines and reviews the associated methodologies and frameworks. In this way, the RMC helps the decision-making bodies to ensure an appropriate level of protection for the Eurosystem.
Financial risks arise from the ECB’s core activities and associated exposures. The risk control frameworks and limits that the ECB uses to manage its risk profile differ across types of operation, reflecting the policy or investment objectives of the different portfolios and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
To monitor and assess the risks, the ECB relies on a number of risk estimation techniques developed by its experts. These techniques are based on a joint market and credit risk simulation framework. The core modelling concepts, techniques and assumptions underlying the risk measures draw on industry standards and available market data. The risks are typically quantified as the expected shortfall (ES),
[
16
]
estimated at the 99% confidence level over a one-year horizon. Two approaches are used to calculate risks: (i) the accounting approach, under which the ECB’s revaluation accounts are considered as a buffer in the calculation of risk estimates in line with all applicable accounting rules; and (ii) the financial approach, under which the revaluation accounts are not considered as a buffer in the risk calculation. The ECB also calculates other risk measures at different confidence levels, performs sensitivity and stress scenario analyses, and assesses longer-term projections of exposures and income to maintain a comprehensive picture of the risks.
[
17
]
The total risks of the ECB increased during the year. At the end of 2021 the total financial risks for all the ECB’s portfolios combined, as measured by the ES at the 99% confidence level over a one-year horizon under the accounting approach, stood at €15.3 billion, which was €2.5 billion higher than the risks estimated as at the end of 2020 (Chart 20). The rise in estimated risks continues a trend which began in 2020 and reflects the growth of the ECB’s monetary policy portfolios as a result of asset purchases conducted under the PEPP and the APP.
Chart 20
Total financial risks (ES 99% accounting approach)
(EUR billions)

Credit risk arises from the ECB’s monetary policy portfolios, its euro-denominated own funds portfolio and its foreign reserve holdings. While securities held for monetary policy purposes are valued at amortised cost subject to impairment and are therefore, in the absence of sales, not subject to price changes associated with credit migrations, they are still subject to credit default risk. Euro-denominated own funds and foreign reserves are valued at market prices and, as such, are subject to credit migration and default risk. Credit risk increased compared with the previous year owing to the expansion of the ECB’s Balance Sheet through purchases of securities under the APP and the PEPP.
Credit risk is mitigated mainly through the application of eligibility criteria, due diligence procedures and limits that differ across portfolios.
Currency and commodity risks arise from the ECB’s foreign currency and gold holdings. The currency risk decreased compared to the previous year owing to higher currency revaluation accounts, which act as buffers against adverse exchange rate movements.
In view of the policy role of these assets, the ECB does not hedge the related currency and commodity risks. Instead, these risks are mitigated through the existence of revaluation accounts and the diversification of the holdings across different currencies and gold.
The ECB’s foreign reserves and euro-denominated own funds are mainly invested in fixed income securities and are subject to mark-to-market interest rate risk, given that they are valued at market prices. The ECB’s foreign reserves are mainly invested in assets with relatively short maturities (see Chart 7 in Section 1.3.1 “Balance Sheet”), while the assets in the own funds portfolio generally have longer maturities (see Chart 9 in Section 1.3.1 “Balance Sheet”). The interest rate risk of these portfolios, as measured under the accounting approach, increased slightly compared to 2020, reflecting developments in market conditions.
The mark-to-market interest rate risk of the ECB is mitigated through asset allocation policies and the revaluation accounts.
The ECB is also subject to interest rate risk arising from mismatches between the interest rate earned on its assets and the interest rate paid on its liabilities, which has an impact on its net interest income. This risk is not directly linked to any particular portfolio but rather to the structure of the ECB’s Balance Sheet as a whole and, in particular, the existence of maturity and yield mismatches between assets and liabilities. It is monitored by means of projections of the ECB’s profitability, which indicate that the ECB is expected to continue to earn net interest income in the coming years.
This type of risk is managed through asset allocation policies and is further mitigated by the existence of unremunerated liabilities on the ECB’s Balance Sheet.
1.4.2 Operational risk
The Executive Board is responsible for and approves the ECB’s operational risk
[

management (ORM) policy and framework. The Operational Risk Committee (ORC) supports the Executive Board in the performance of its role in overseeing the management of operational risks. ORM is an integral part of the ECB’s governance structure
[
19
]
and management processes.
The main objective of the ECB’s ORM framework is to contribute to ensuring that the ECB achieves its mission and objectives, while protecting its reputation and assets against loss, misuse and damage. Under the ORM framework, each business area is responsible for identifying, assessing, responding to, reporting on and monitoring its operational risks, incidents and controls. In this context, the ECB’s risk tolerance policy provides guidance with regard to risk response strategies and risk acceptance procedures. It is linked to a five-by-five risk matrix based on impact and likelihood grading scales using quantitative and qualitative criteria.
The environment in which the ECB operates is exposed to increasingly complex and interconnected threats and there are a wide range of operational risks associated with the ECB’s day-to-day activities. The main areas of concern for the ECB include a wide spectrum of non-financial risks resulting from people, information, systems, processes and external third-party providers. Consequently, the ECB has put in place processes to facilitate ongoing and effective management of its operational risks and to integrate risk information into the decision-making process. Moreover, the ECB is focusing on enhancing its resilience, taking a broad view of risks and opportunities from an end-to-end perspective, including sustainability aspects. As such, response structures and contingency plans have been established to ensure the continuity of critical business functions in the event of any disruption or crisis (such as the COVID-19 pandemic).
1.4.3 Conduct risk
The ECB has a dedicated Compliance and Governance Office as a key risk management function to strengthen the ECB’s governance framework in order to address conduct risk
[
20
]
at the ECB. Its purpose is to support the Executive Board in protecting the integrity and reputation of the ECB, to promote ethical standards of behaviour and to strengthen the ECB’s accountability and transparency. A high-level ECB Ethics Committee provides advice and guidance to high-level ECB officials on integrity and conduct matters and supports the Governing Council in managing related risks at executive level appropriately and coherently. At the level of the Eurosystem and the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Ethics and Compliance Conference works towards achieving coherent implementation of the conduct frameworks for NCBs and national competent authorities (NCAs).

2.3 Accounting policies
Form and presentation of the financial statements
The financial statements of the ECB have been drawn up in accordance with the following accounting policies,
[
21
]


which, in the view of the Governing Council of the ECB, achieve a fair presentation of the financial statements, reflecting at the same time the nature of central bank activities.
Accounting principles
The following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and transparency, prudence, recognition of post-balance sheet events, materiality, going concern, the accruals principle, consistency and comparability.
Recognition of assets and liabilities
An asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that any associated future economic benefit will flow to or from the ECB, substantially all of the associated risks and rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of the asset or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, modified to include the market valuation of marketable securities (other than securities currently held for monetary policy purposes), gold and all other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency.
Transactions in financial assets and liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the date on which they were settled.
With the exception of spot transactions in securities, transactions in financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. At the settlement date the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed, and transactions are booked on-balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade date, and realised results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, premiums and discounts related to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign currency position is also affected daily by these accruals.
Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a currency-by-currency basis.
Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency is treated separately from the exchange rate revaluation.
Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the balance sheet date. No distinction is made between the price and currency revaluation differences for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is accounted for on the basis of the price in euro per fine ounce of gold, which, for the year ending 31 December 2021, was derived from the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar on 31 December 2021.
The special drawing right (SDR) is defined in terms of a basket of currencies and its value is determined by the weighted sum of the exchange rates of five major currencies (the US dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen and pound sterling). The ECB’s holdings of SDRs were converted into euro using the exchange rate of the euro against the SDR as at 31 December 2021.
Securities
Securities held for monetary policy purposes
Securities currently held for monetary policy purposes are accounted for at amortised cost subject to impairment.
Other securities
Marketable securities (other than securities currently held for monetary policy purposes) and similar assets are valued either at the mid-market prices or on the basis of the relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance sheet date, on a security-by-security basis. Options embedded in securities are not separated for valuation purposes. For the year ending 31 December 2021, mid-market prices on 30 December 2021 were used.
Marketable investment funds are revalued on a net basis at fund level, using their net asset value. No netting is applied between unrealised gains and losses in different investment funds.
Illiquid equity shares and any other equity instruments held as permanent investments are valued at cost subject to impairment.
Income recognition
Income and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred.
[
22
]
Realised gains and losses resulting from the sale of foreign currency, gold and securities are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account. Such realised gains and losses are calculated by reference to the average cost of the respective asset.
Unrealised gains are not recognised as income and are transferred directly to a revaluation account.
Unrealised losses are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account if, at the year-end, they exceed previous revaluation gains accumulated in the corresponding revaluation account. Such unrealised losses on any one security or currency or on gold are not netted against unrealised gains on other securities or currencies or gold. In the event of such unrealised losses on any item recorded in the Profit and Loss Account, the average cost of that item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate or market price.
Impairment losses are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account and are not reversed in subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related to an observable event that occurred after the impairment was first recorded.
Premiums or discounts arising on securities are amortised over the securities’ remaining contractual life.
Reverse transactions
Reverse transactions are operations whereby the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.
Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised deposits on the liability side of the Balance Sheet. Securities sold under such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet of the ECB.
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous agreement to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised loans on the asset side of the Balance Sheet, but are not included in the ECB’s security holdings.
Reverse transactions (including securities lending transactions) conducted under a programme offered by a specialised institution are recorded on the Balance Sheet only where collateral has been provided in the form of cash and this cash remains uninvested.
Off-balance-sheet instruments
Currency instruments, namely foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one currency for another at a future date, are included in the net foreign currency position for the purpose of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses.
Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation margin of open interest rate futures contracts, as well as interest rate swaps that are cleared via a central counterparty, are recorded in the Profit and Loss Account. The valuation of forward transactions in securities is carried out by the ECB based on generally accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates, as well as discount factors from the settlement dates to the valuation date.
Fixed assets
Fixed assets, including intangible assets, but excluding land and works of art, are valued at cost less depreciation. Land and works of art are valued at cost. The ECB’s main building is valued at cost less depreciation subject to impairment. For the depreciation of the ECB’s main building, costs are assigned to the appropriate asset components, which are depreciated in accordance with their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, beginning in the quarter after the asset is available for use. The useful lives applied for the main asset classes are as follows:
The depreciation period for capitalised refurbishment expenditure relating to the ECB’s existing rented premises is adjusted to take account of any events that have an impact on the expected useful life of the affected asset.
The ECB performs an annual impairment test of its main building and right-of-use assets relating to office buildings (see “Leases” below). If an impairment indicator is identified, and it is assessed that the asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recorded in the Profit and Loss Account if the recoverable amount is less than the net book value.
Fixed assets costing less than €10,000 are written off in the year of acquisition.
Fixed assets that comply with the capitalisation criteria, but are still under construction or development, are recorded under the heading “Assets under construction”. The related costs are transferred to the relevant fixed asset headings once the assets are available for use.
Leases
For all leases involving a tangible asset, the related right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lease commencement date and included under “Tangible and intangible fixed assets” and “Sundry” (liabilities), respectively. Where leases comply with the capitalisation criteria, but the asset involved is still under construction or adaptation, the incurred costs before the lease commencement date are recorded under the heading “Assets under construction”. The related right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised under the relevant fixed asset headings once the asset is available for use (lease commencement date).
Right-of-use assets are valued at cost less depreciation. In addition, right-of-use assets relating to office buildings are subject to impairment (regarding the annual impairment test, see “Fixed assets” above). Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to either the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is earlier.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments (comprising only lease components), discounted using the ECB's incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The related interest expense is recorded in the Profit and Loss Account under “Other interest expense”. When there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or other reassessment of the existing contract, the lease liability is remeasured. Any such remeasurement results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.
Short-term leases with a duration of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets below €10,000 (consistent with the threshold used for the recognition of fixed assets) are recorded as an expense in the Profit and Loss Account.
The ECB’s post-employment benefits, other long-term benefits and termination benefits
The ECB operates defined benefit plans for its staff and the members of the Executive Board, as well as for the members of the Supervisory Board employed by the ECB.
The staff pension plan is funded by assets held in a long-term employee benefit fund. The compulsory contributions made by the ECB and the staff are reflected in the defined benefit pillar of the plan. Staff can make additional contributions on a voluntary basis in a defined contribution pillar that can be used to provide additional benefits.
[
23
]
These additional benefits are determined by the amount of voluntary contributions together with the investment returns arising from those contributions.
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the post-employment and other long-term benefits of members of the Executive Board and members of the Supervisory Board employed by the ECB. For staff, unfunded arrangements are in place for post-employment benefits other than pensions and for other long-term benefits and termination benefits.
Net defined benefit liability
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet under “Sundry” (liabilities) in respect of the defined benefit plans, including other long-term benefits and termination benefits, is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets used to fund the related obligation.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality euro-denominated corporate bonds that have similar terms to maturity to the related obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual outcomes are different from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
Net defined benefit cost
The net defined benefit cost is split into components reported in the Profit and Loss Account and remeasurements in respect of post-employment benefits shown in the Balance Sheet under “Revaluation accounts”.
The net amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account comprises:
the current service cost of the defined benefits accruing for the year;
the past service cost of the defined benefits resulting from a plan amendment;
net interest at the discount rate on the net defined benefit liability;
remeasurements in respect of other long-term benefits and termination benefits of a long-term nature, if any, in their entirety.
The net amount shown under “Revaluation accounts” comprises the following items:
actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation;
the actual return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability;
any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
These amounts are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the appropriate liability in the financial statements.
Intra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balances
Intra-ESCB balances result primarily from cross-border payments in the European Union (EU) that are settled in central bank money in euro. These transactions are for the most part initiated by private entities (i.e. credit institutions, corporations and individuals). They are settled in TARGET2 – the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system – and give rise to bilateral balances in the TARGET2 accounts of EU central banks. These bilateral balances are netted and then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each national central bank (NCB) with a single net bilateral position vis-à-vis the ECB only. Payments conducted by the ECB and settled in TARGET2 also affect the single net bilateral positions. These positions in the books of the ECB represent the net claim or liability of each NCB against the rest of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Intra-Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB arising from TARGET2, as well as other intra-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro (e.g. the ECB’s interim profit distribution to NCBs), are presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or liability position under either “Other claims within the Eurosystem (net)” or “Other liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)”. Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB, arising from their participation in TARGET2,
[
24
]
are disclosed under “Liabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euro”.
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem are included as a single net asset under “Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem” (see “Banknotes in circulation” below).
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB by NCBs joining the Eurosystem are denominated in euro and reported under “Liabilities equivalent to the transfer of foreign reserves”.
Banknotes in circulation
The ECB and the euro area NCBs, which together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro banknotes.
[
25
]
The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central banks on the last working day of each month in accordance with the banknote allocation key.
[
26
]
The ECB has been allocated an 8% share of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, which is disclosed in the Balance Sheet under the liability item “Banknotes in circulation”. The ECB’s share of the total euro banknote issue is backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, which bear interest,
[
27
]
are disclosed under the sub-item “Intra-Eurosystem claims: claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem” (see “Intra-ESCB balances/intra-Eurosystem balances” above). Interest income on these claims is included in the Profit and Loss Account under the item “Interest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem”.
Interim profit distribution
An amount that is equal to the sum of the ECB’s income on euro banknotes in circulation and income arising from the securities held for monetary policy purposes purchased under (i) the Securities Markets Programme, (ii) the third covered bond purchase programme, (iii) the asset-backed securities purchase programme, (iv) the public sector purchase programme, and (v) the pandemic emergency purchase programme is distributed in January of the following year by means of an interim profit distribution, unless otherwise decided by the Governing Council.
[
28
]
It is distributed in full unless it is higher than the ECB’s net profit for the year and subject to any decisions by the Governing Council to make transfers to the provision for financial risks. The Governing Council may also decide to reduce the amount of the income on euro banknotes in circulation to be distributed in January by the amount of the costs incurred by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of euro banknotes.
Post-balance sheet events
The values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance sheet date and the date on which the Executive Board authorises the submission of the ECB’s Annual Accounts to the Governing Council for approval, if such events materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Important post-balance sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.
Changes to accounting policies
In 2021 there were no changes to the accounting policies applied by the ECB.
Other issues
In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation of the Governing Council, the EU Council has approved the appointment of Baker Tilly GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf (Federal Republic of Germany) as the external auditors of the ECB for a five-year period up to the end of the financial year 2022. This five-year period can be extended for up to two additional financial years.

, the market value of which amounted to €26,121 million (2020: €25,056 million). No gold operations took place in 2021 and the ECB’s holdings therefore remained unchanged compared with their level as at 31 December 2020. The increase in the euro equivalent value of these holdings was due to the rise in the market price of gold in euro terms (see “Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies” and note 15 “Revaluation accounts”).
Note 2 - Claims on non-euro area and euro area residents denominated in foreign currency
Note 2.1 - Receivables from the IMF
This asset represents the ECB’s holdings of SDRs and amounted to €1,234 million as at 31 December 2021 (2020: €680 million). It arises as the result of a two-way SDR buying and selling voluntary trading arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of the ECB, within minimum and maximum holding levels. For accounting purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency (see “Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”). The ECB’s holdings in SDRs increased in 2021, mainly as a result of transactions that took place in the context of the above-mentioned voluntary trading arrangement. The appreciation of the SDR against the euro during 2021 also contributed to the increase in the euro equivalent value of these holdings.
Note 2.2 - Balances with banks and security investments, external loans and other external assets; and claims on euro area residents denominated in foreign currency
These two items consist of balances with banks and loans denominated in foreign currency, and investments in securities denominated in US dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
The total value of these items increased in 2021, mainly owing to the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro.
The ECB’s net foreign currency holdings
[

]
were as follows:
No foreign exchange interventions took place during 2021.
Note 3 - Claims on non-euro area residents denominated in euro
Note 3.1 - Balances with banks, security investments and loans
As at 31 December 2021 this item consisted of a claim amounting to €3,070 million (2020: €1,830 million) in relation to liquidity facility arrangements between the Eurosystem and non-euro area central banks. Under these arrangements, the Eurosystem provides euro liquidity to non-euro area central banks in exchange for eligible collateral
[
31
]
to address euro liquidity needs in their jurisdictions in case of market dysfunction and thereby minimise the risk of adverse spillover effects on euro area financial markets and economies.
Note 4 - Other claims on euro area credit institutions denominated in euro
As at 31 December 2021 this item consisted of current account balances with euro area residents amounting to €38 million (2020: €81 million).
Note 5 - Securities of euro area residents denominated in euro
Note 5.1 - Securities held for monetary policy purposes
As at 31 December 2021 this item consisted of securities acquired by the ECB within the scope of the three covered bond purchase programmes (CBPPs), the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).
1) Further eligibility criteria for the specific programmes can be found in the Governing Council’s decisions.
2) Only public debt securities issued by five euro area treasuries were purchased under the SMP.
3) The ECB does not acquire securities under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).
4) A waiver of the eligibility requirements was granted for securities issued by the Greek Government.
In 2021 the Eurosystem conducted net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP)
[
32
]
at a monthly pace of €20 billion on average. In December 2021 the Governing Council decided
[
33
]
on a monthly net purchase pace of €40 billion in the second quarter and €30 billion in the third quarter of 2022. From October 2022 onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and expects to end these purchases shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council also intends to continue the reinvestments for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
In addition, in 2021 the Eurosystem continued its net asset purchases under the PEPP
[
34
]
, with a total envelope of €1,850 billion
[
35
]
. Purchases were conducted in a flexible manner based on the assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook. In December 2021 the Governing Council also decided to discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022, but these could be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Furthermore, the Governing Council extended the reinvestment horizon for the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions and at any time. The future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The securities purchased under these programmes are valued on an amortised cost basis subject to impairment (see “Securities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”).
The amortised cost of the securities held by the ECB and their market value
[

(which is not recorded on the Balance Sheet or in the Profit and Loss Account and is provided for comparison purposes only) are as follows:
The amortised cost value of the securities held by the ECB changed during the year as follows:
1) ""Net discount/(premium)"" includes net realised gains/(losses), if any.
The Governing Council assesses on a regular basis the financial risks associated with the securities held under these programmes.
In this context, impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis, using data as at the year-end, and are approved by the Governing Council. In these tests, impairment indicators are assessed separately for each programme. In cases where impairment indicators are observed, further analysis is performed to confirm that the cash flows of the underlying securities have not been affected by an impairment event. Based on the results of this year’s impairment tests, no losses have been recorded by the ECB for the securities held in its monetary policy portfolios in 2021.
The amortised cost value of the securities held by the Eurosystem is as follows:
Note: “Euro area NCBs” figures are preliminary and may be subject to revision, which would also result in an equivalent change in the “Total Eurosystem” figures.
Note 6 - Intra-Eurosystem claims
Note 6.1 - Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem
This item consists of the claims of the ECB vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs relating to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem (see “Banknotes in circulation” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”) and as at 31 December 2021 amounted to €123,551 million (2020: €114,761 million). The remuneration of these claims is calculated daily at the latest available marginal interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations
[
37
]
(see note 22.2 “Interest income arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem”).
Note 7 - Other assets
Note 7.1 - Tangible and intangible fixed assets
These assets comprised the following items:
In respect of the ECB’s main building and right-of-use office buildings, an impairment test was conducted at the end of the year and no impairment loss has been recorded.
Note 7.2 - Other financial assets
This item consists mainly of the ECB’s own funds portfolio, which predominantly consists of investments of the ECB’s financial resources, namely the paid-up capital and amounts held in the reserves and the provision for financial risks. It also includes 3,211 shares in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at the acquisition cost of €42 million and other current accounts denominated in euro.
The components of this item are as follows:
The net increase in this item in 2021 was primarily due to the investment in the ECB’s own funds portfolio of (i) the amounts paid up by the euro area NCBs in 2021 in respect of the first instalment of their increased subscriptions in the ECB’s capital (see note 16 “Capital and reserves”); (ii) the interest income generated on this portfolio in 2021; and (iii) the counterpart of the amount transferred to the ECB’s provision for financial risks in 2020. The increase in this item was partially offset, mainly by the decline in the market value of securities held in the ECB’s own funds portfolio.
Note 7.3 - Off-balance-sheet instruments revaluation differences
This item is composed of valuation changes in swap and forward transactions in foreign currency that were outstanding on 31 December 2021 (see note 20 “Foreign exchange swap and forward transactions”). These valuation changes amounted to €620 million (2020: €388 million) and are the result of the conversion of such transactions into their euro equivalents at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, compared with the euro values resulting from the conversion of the transactions at the average cost of the respective foreign currency on that date (see “Off-balance-sheet instruments” and “Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”).
Note 7.4 - Accruals and prepaid expenses
On 31 December 2021 this item stood at €4,055 million (2020: €3,390 million). It comprised mainly accrued coupon interest on securities, including outstanding interest paid at acquisition, amounting to €3,332 million (2020: €2,757 million) (see note 2.2 “Balances with banks and security investments, external loans and other external assets; and claims on euro area residents denominated in foreign currency”, note 5 “Securities of euro area residents denominated in euro” and note 7.2 “Other financial assets”).
This item also included an amount of €577 million corresponding to the supervisory fees to be received for the fee period 2021 (see note 25 “Net income/expense from fees and commissions”).
[
38
]
This amount will be collected in 2022.
This item also includes (i) accrued income from common Eurosystem projects (see note 27 “Other income”); (ii) miscellaneous prepayments; and (iii) accrued interest income on other financial assets and liabilities.
Note 7.5 - Sundry
On 31 December 2021 this item amounted to €749 million (2020: €1,970 million) and mainly comprised balances with a value of €573 million (2020: €692 million) related to swap and forward transactions in foreign currency outstanding on 31 December 2021 (see note 20 “Foreign exchange swap and forward transactions”). These balances arose from the conversion of such transactions into their euro equivalents at the respective currency’s average cost on the balance sheet date, compared with the euro values at which the transactions were initially recorded (see “Off-balance-sheet instruments” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”).
It also included the accrued amount of the ECB’s interim profit distribution of €150 million (2020: €1,260 million) (see “Interim profit distribution” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies” and note 12.2 “Other liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)”).
Note 8 - Banknotes in circulation
This item consists of the ECB’s share (8%) of total euro banknotes in circulation (see “Banknotes in circulation” in Section 2.3 “Accounting policies”) and as at 31 December 2021 amounted to €123,551 million (2020: €114,761 million).
Note 9 - Other liabilities to euro area credit institutions denominated in euro
The Eurosystem central banks have the possibility of accepting cash as collateral in their PSPP securities lending facilities without having to reinvest it. In the case of the ECB, these operations are conducted via a specialised institution. The same conditions apply to the public sector PEPP holdings.
As at 31 December 2021 the outstanding value of such lending transactions against cash collateral conducted with euro area credit institutions was €9,473 million (2020: €2,559 million). Cash received as collateral was"

FX Global Code promotes robust, fair, liquid, open and appropriately transparent foreign exchange market
European System of Central Banks publicly reaffirms commitment to updated Code
Code first published in 2017 and updated mid-2021
The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) welcomes the July 2021 update of the FX Global Code and the publication of related guidance material. With this global code on foreign exchange, participants in foreign exchange markets aim to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open and appropriately transparent foreign exchange market underpinned by high ethical standards. The Code has been updated by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee to keep it relevant and aligned with the ongoing evolution of the foreign exchange market and will continue to set the standard for good market practice. Well-functioning financial markets benefit all market participants and are important to central banks because they ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. This ultimately benefits the public at large.
Today all members of the ESCB, including the European Central Bank (ECB), simultaneously issued renewed Statements of Commitment to the Code. This demonstrates their strong commitment to adhere to its principles when acting as foreign exchange market participants, to align their internal practices and processes with its updated principles, and to support and promote adherence to the Code. With these Statements of Commitment, they emphasise that the principles of the Code are important in ensuring the continued integrity and effective functioning of the foreign exchange market. To fully achieve the objective of the Code, the EU central banks also encourage foreign exchange market participants in their jurisdictions to review the updated Code and renew their Statements of Commitment.
For media queries, please contact Verena Reith, tel.: +49 69 1344 5737.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-September 2021, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover information required for the analysis of the EU banking sector, comprising a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-September 2021 data refer to 323 banking groups and 2,511 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector balance sheet. This dataset includes an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting of the European Banking Authority. However some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
A few revisions to past data are disclosed together with the end-September 2021 data.

HICP inflation expectations revised up, particularly for 2022
Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged but expected temporary slower growth around the start of 2022
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2022, HICP inflation expectations stood at 3.0%, 1.8% and 1.9% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. Compared with the previous round for the fourth quarter of 2021, expectations were revised up by 1.1 percentage points for 2022 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2023 (expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the previous round). Respondents attributed the upward revisions mainly to further increases in energy prices and the ongoing impact of demand-supply imbalances. At the same time, they continue to expect inflation to fall – to 1.8% by December 2022. Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 stood at 2.0%, revised up from 1.9% in the previous round.
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents’ expectations were largely unchanged, with counteracting revisions for 2022 (downwards) and 2023 (upwards). Based on their profile of expected quarter-on-quarter growth between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2022, respondents expect the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to result in temporarily slower economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 but a rebound in the second and third quarters of 2022. Overall, growth expectations continue to imply that economic activity exceeded its pre-pandemic level (fourth quarter of 2019) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Respondents now expect the level of GDP to rise above the path expected before the pandemic in 2023 (compared with 2024 in the previous round). Average longer-term expectations for real GDP growth were unchanged at 1.5%.
Unemployment rate expectations were revised down by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points for all horizons. SPF respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 7.2% in 2022 to 6.7% by 2026. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level for 15 years."
,"Summary
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2022, HICP inflation expectations were revised up, standing at 3.0%, 1.8% and 1.9% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.
[

]
Compared with the previous round (fourth quarter of 2021), these were higher by 1.1 percentage points for 2022 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2023 (expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the previous round). Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 were revised up to 2.0% from 1.9% in the previous round, implying a notable upward movement of between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points of longer-term inflation expectations over the past three rounds. GDP growth expectations were revised down for 2022, up for 2023 and remained the same for the longer term. The profile of GDP in level terms was on average broadly unchanged. The profile of the expected unemployment rate was revised down for all horizons by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points. Indicators of the uncertainty surrounding expectations for the main macroeconomic variables remained elevated compared with pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) levels.

1 HICP inflation expectations revised up, particularly for 2022
SPF respondents revised up their inflation expectations across all horizons, but most noticeably for 2022. Inflation expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024 were 3.0%, 1.8% and 1.9% respectively (see Chart 1). For 2022 and 2023 this implies upward revisions of 1.1 and 0.1 percentage points compared with the previous survey (for the fourth quarter of 2021). Expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the previous round. Compared with the December 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, inflation expectations in this SPF round were lower by 0.2 percentage points for 2022, the same for 2023 and were higher by 0.1 percentage points for 2024 (see Table 1).
Chart 1
Inflation expectations: overall HICP inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco
(annual percentage changes)
Regarding the near-term outlook, respondents reported high energy prices and demand-supply imbalances as the main factors behind their upward revision to the 2022 inflation forecast. Both these factors were cited as factors behind upward revisions in the previous round, but the recent developments were seen to have been even more intense and more persistent than previously anticipated. However, respondents indicated that they still consider that these effects will not be long lasting. This qualitative assessment is supported by their forecasts as, notwithstanding the large upward revision to the average annual inflation rate forecast for 2022 as a whole, respondents still expect a substantial decline in inflation during the course of 2022. Their one-year ahead forecast for inflation in December 2022 was 1.8% and represents a considerable expected decline compared with the latest available inflation data (5.0% HICP flash estimate for December 2021). This was attributed in part to base effects from the increases observed already in 2021 as well to expectations that some energy market tensions and demand-supply imbalances will ease by the end of 2022 (previously this easing was expected in the first half of 2022).
Respondents did not substantially change their assessment of the broader factors influencing the more medium-term inflation outlook. In addition to their regular, more general assessment, respondents were also asked to “elaborate, (a) whether, and to what extent, you have included second-round effects of the currently elevated inflation rate in your baseline forecast and probability distributions for wages; and (b) to what extent your inflation expectations include a general (re)assessment of the broadness and duration of inflationary pressures”. On expected wage developments, while many respondents expected an increase in negotiated wages in 2022, they generally believed this was partly a recompense for low increases in 2021 and higher inflation; and it would not presage the start of a so-called wage-price spiral.
[
2
]
At the same time, wages were identified as a key risk indicator to be monitored for signs of more sustained inflationary pressures should elevated increases in negotiated wages materialise and persist beyond 2022. Although many respondents expected higher negotiated wages in 2022 compared with 2021, on average they did not revise up the profile of their expected labour cost developments over the period 2022-24. More generally, some respondents considered that recent inflation developments indicated a substantially changed inflation regime, whilst others considered that they marked the end of “too low” inflation but not the start of “too high” inflation. A number of respondents expected that if the pandemic situation normalises, there might be a shift away from goods inflation toward services inflation but no overall increase in the broadness of inflationary pressures per se.
For the shorter and medium-term horizons, quantitative indicators of uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook increased further and those for the balance of risks were on the upside.
[
3
]
Quantitative indicators of uncertainty for inflation derived from the reported probability distributions increased further to reach historically high levels. For the one and two-year ahead horizons, the increase in “aggregate uncertainty” owed to a combination of higher “disagreement” across forecasters about their point forecasts as well as a higher average level of “individual uncertainty”, with the former contributing more to the increase. The aggregate probability distributions for the calendar years from 2022 to 2024 are presented in Chart 2. The quantitative balance of risk indicator (calculated as the estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution minus the average reported point expectation) for shorter horizons was generally to the upside. In their qualitative remarks, respondents reported elevated uncertainties for the short-term inflation outlook in particular regarding the evolution of energy prices (and their indirect effects), of demand-supply imbalances and of the pandemic situation more generally. Considering the more medium-term risks, the key factor identified was the evolution of wages.
SPF expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were revised up for all horizons. HICPX expectations for 2022, 2023 and 2024 stood at 2.0%, 1.8% and 1.9% representing upward revisions of 0.5 percentage points for 2022 and 0.2 percentage points for 2023. Expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the previous round. Respondents indicated that the upward revisions reflect a higher starting point as well as indirect effects from higher energy prices and effects from demand-supply imbalances. The expected profile of HICPX inflation has changed somewhat in that there is now some easing from a higher rate while previously there had been expectations of a gradual and continuous strengthening from lower levels. Respondents still expect an upward impact on underlying inflationary dynamics from a gradual reduction in economic slack, but this appears to be offset by an easing impact from current supply bottlenecks and from the indirect effects of high energy prices. The SPF forecasts for HICPX were slightly higher (by 0.1 percentage points) than those from the December 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for 2022, 2023 and 2024 (see Table 1).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in 2022, 2023 and 2024. Expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the previous two rounds.
2 Longer-term inflation expectations revised up to 2.0%
Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2026) averaged 2.0%, an upward revision from 1.9% in the previous round. Having remained in a narrow range (1.64-1.69%) in the SPF rounds between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021, longer-term inflation expectations have moved up noticeably in the last three rounds (third and fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022). While part of this upward movement was due to a relatively strong outlier, the upward revision over the last three rounds excluding this outlier was still relatively strong at 0.22 percentage points (from 1.68% to 1.90%). In this round (first quarter of 2022), considering a balanced panel of those who also replied in the fourth quarter of 2021 round, many more respondents revised their longer-term inflation expectations upward than downward.
[
4
]
The median point expectation increased to 1.9%. The estimated mean of the aggregate probability distribution remained unchanged at 1.9% (see Chart 3). The distribution of individual point forecasts has changed considerably when compared with recent rounds (i.e. from the first quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2021 – see Chart 4). There were many more respondents reporting 2.0% and the mode of the distribution was clearly at 2.0% (for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015 round).

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the spread of point forecast responses.
Uncertainty surrounding longer-term inflation expectations increased further while the balance of risks became more negative. The increase in the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution (see Chart 5) owed to a combination of higher disagreement and higher individual uncertainty. The apparent downward shift in the balance of risk indicator was due to the outlier mentioned above – excluding the outlier, the balance of risks was still to the downside but broadly unchanged from the previous round. The probability associated with longer-term inflation being negative remained unchanged from the previous round, at around 2%. The probability associated with longer-term inflation being in the range of 1.5-2.5% remained unchanged at 52%, with a 20% probability above this range and a 28% probability below this range.

Notes: The SPF asks respondents to report their point forecasts and to separately assign probabilities to different ranges of outcomes. This chart shows the average probabilities they assigned to different ranges of inflation outcomes in the longer term.
The longer-term expectations for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX) were also revised upward. They increased to 1.9% for 2026, up from 1.8% in the previous round. The median longer-term point expectation for HICPX was unchanged at 1.8%. Half of the respondents who provided longer-term HICPX expectations in both the first quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021 rounds revised them up and none revised them down. The evolution of longer-term expectations for HICP and HICPX inflation has been broadly similar for the period of available data since the fourth quarter of 2016, and the level difference of around 0.1 percentage points on average has remained broadly unchanged also in the first quarter of 2022 round.
3 Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged
GDP growth expectations in the first quarter of 2022 survey round stood at 4.2% for 2022, 2.7% for 2023 and 1.7% for 2024 (see Chart 6). These imply opposing revisions compared with the previous round: a downward revision of 0.3 percentage points for 2022 and an upward revision of 0.5 percentage points for 2023. Respondents explained their downward revisions for 2022 by the loss of economic momentum caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19), higher energy prices curtailing purchasing power, and deferred production owing to persistent supply chain bottlenecks. Respondents pointed to downside risks to growth from economic sectors such as services industries, particularly tourism, hospitality and air travel, which continue to suffer from the effects of COVID-19. Looking ahead, they expected the euro area economy largely to continue its ongoing recovery from the pandemic. The spending of accumulated savings and fiscal stimulus from the European recovery plan were identified as upward risks by some respondents. Several also mentioned the probability that new strict lockdowns could be avoided as high vaccination rates should permit activity to return to a more normal path. They noted that the new COVID-19 variant seems to imply fewer hospitalisations than last winter, and that Europeans appear better prepared to cope. Further, according to some respondents, bottlenecks should start to ease in the second half of 2022 and into 2023, with less pandemic-related disruption and more capacity in maritime transportation, together with greater availability of semiconductors for manufacturing. Downside risks to this scenario from continuing high inflation, a slowdown in global trade and a worse than anticipated path of COVID-19 infections were mentioned. Longer-term growth expectations (which refer to 2026) remained at 1.5%.

Actual quarterly GDP growth for the third quarter of 2021 was 2.2%, similar to the forecast of 2.1% in the previous SPF round.

]
In this round, forecasters expected a clearer slowdown in quarter-on-quarter growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 0.4% (lower than the 1.0% expected in the previous round). They then forecast growth in real GDP of around the same pace (0.5%) in the first quarter of 2022. Growth was then expected to be higher in the second and third quarters of 2022, at 1.2% and 1.0% respectively (see Chart 7). Compared with the December 2021 Broad Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (BMPE), SPF respondents were on average more optimistic for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, and slightly less optimistic for the second and third quarters of 2022. On average, over the four quarters, expectations were broadly similar.
Chart 7
Expected profile of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth
(quarter-on-quarter percentage changes)
Notes: Grey area indicates one standard deviation (of individual expectations) around average SPF expectation.
Real GDP is estimated to have returned above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to exceed the pre-COVID-19 profile in 2023 – see Chart 8. The counteracting revisions to expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 (downwards) and those for the second and third quarters of 2022 (upwards) mean that the expected profile of GDP in level terms is broadly unchanged. However, GDP in level terms is now expected to exceed the path expected prior to the pandemic in 2023 compared with 2024 in the previous round. Expected GDP levels are also marginally higher than forecast in the December 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.

Forecast profile of real GDP level
(2019 = 100)
Notes: Growth expectations for years not surveyed have been interpolated linearly.
Quantitative measures of uncertainty provided mixed signals in this round (see Chart 9 and Chart 10). Aggregate uncertainty decreased somewhat at the two-year ahead horizon but increased slightly for the longer term. Overall, uncertainty was still elevated by historical standards but also considerably lower than at its peak in the second and third quarters of 2020. Many of the risk factors identified in the qualitative comments were the same factors mentioned when explaining the baseline forecasts. On the upside these included the possibility that the pandemic situation evolves more favourably as well as the possible release of pent-up consumer demand and savings. Respondents also pointed to downside risks, with the most cited ones being supply bottlenecks and rising inflation, which threaten to reduce the disposable income of households and therefore demand, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the future path of the pandemic.

4 Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
The average point forecasts for the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2022 round were revised further down to 7.2%, 6.9% and 6.8% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. The expectation for 2026 was 6.7% and is the lowest rate recorded for long-term unemployment expectations since the third quarter of 2008. The downward sloping trajectory is broadly similar to that of the previous round but at a level lower by 0.2-0.3 percentage points (see Chart 11). Respondents attributed the downward revisions to the continued improvement in the labour market, the lower realised data of 2021 and the ongoing economic recovery. The end of government support measures was mentioned as the main upside risk to unemployment, together with labour scarcity from some sectors and the possible impact of the large accumulation of household savings on labour force participation rates. However, a few respondents also mentioned the possibility that higher wages might compensate for higher inflation as an upside risk to unemployment.
Chart 11
Expectations for the unemployment rate
(percentages of the labour force)
Uncertainty surrounding unemployment rate expectations increased for the shorter horizons and still stands at elevated levels, while overall risks were to the upside for all horizons. On balance, the probability distributions showed marginally (positive) skewness toward higher unemployment rate outcomes for both short and long horizons (see Chart 12 and Chart 13). The balance of risk indicator for longer-term expectations remained positive as the mean of the aggregated probability distribution (at 6.9%) was higher than the average point forecast (6.7%).

5 Expectations for other variables
Forecasters expected: the ECB’s key interest rates to remain largely unchanged in 2022 and to increase very marginally in 2023 and 2024; the euro to be largely stable against the dollar at about 1.13 until 2023; oil prices to decrease gradually to levels around USD 70 per barrel until 2023; and nominal wage growth to hover above but close to 2.5% until 2026.
The median (and majority) expectation was for the rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to remain at 0% for the year 2022. Thereafter, however, respondents on average expected interest rates to rise slightly to 0.11% (up from 0.05%) in 2023 and to reach 0.33% by 2024 (see Chart 14a). Overall, expectations for a rise in interest rates in 2023 and 2024 became stronger with about 52% (up from 25%) of forecasters reporting a positive interest rate in 2023 and 74% in 2024, the highest shares since the second quarter of 2019 round.
The expected average USD/EUR exchange rate was revised downward to around 1.13 for the first quarter of 2022 and was expected to remain at that level for the whole of 2022, before marginally increasing at a constant rate up to 1.17 by 2024 (see Chart 14b).
Compared with the previous round, the level of US dollar-denominated oil prices (per barrel) was revised upwards. The revisions were around USD 4 and USD 3 per barrel for 2022 and 2023 respectively. Overall, the profile of expected oil prices follows a downward trajectory from about USD 78 per barrel in the first quarter of 2022 to around USD 70 per barrel in 2024 (see Chart 14c). Given the marginally weaker expectations for the USD/EUR exchange rate over near horizons, the implied revisions to the profile for the oil price in euro terms are somewhat larger compared with revisions in US dollar terms – EUR 6.6 in 2022 and 5.0 EUR in 2023. This implies a profile largely in line with that of assumptions used for the December 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection exercise.
Expectations for the annual growth in compensation per employee were revised down by 0.2 percentage points in 2022 compared with the previous round, while remaining roughly the same in 2023 (see Chart 14d). Although revised down by 0.2 percentage points, long-term expectations stand at 2.5% thereby remaining above the average expected growth rate of about 2.2% recorded between 2012 and 2019 for that horizon. Wage growth is expected to increase from 2.5% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2024 but ease to 2.5% by 2026.

The Governing Council confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting last December.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
In the first quarter of 2022, the Governing Council is conducting net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. It will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
In line with the step-by-step reduction in asset purchases decided on in December 2021 and to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with inflation stabilising at the Governing Council’s target over the medium term, monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and €30 billion in the third quarter. From October onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates. The Governing Council expects net purchases to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
In support of its symmetric 2% inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards tightened slightly for firms and remained unchanged for housing loans
Banks continue to hold overall benign view of firm credit risks, owing mainly to positive assessment of economic outlook
Strong increase in loan demand by firms, driven by higher working capital needs stemming from supply bottlenecks, as well as by financing for longer-term investment
According to the January 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened very slightly (net percentage of banks standing at 2%, see Chart 1) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported unchanged credit standards (net percentage of 0%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households eased moderately (net percentage of -4%). Banks had a generally benign view of firms’ and households’ credit risks based on an overall positive assessment of the economic outlook, despite the current pandemic situation and the dampening impact of supply bottlenecks. In the first quarter of 2022, banks expect credit standards to remain broadly unchanged for loans to firms, to tighten moderately for housing loans and to ease further for consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –were broadly unchanged for loans to firms and loans to households in the fourth quarter of 2021. For margins on average loans, banks continued to report a narrowing in net terms for loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase, whereas margins on riskier loans widened for these loan categories. For consumer credit and other lending to households, both margins on average and riskier loans remained broadly unchanged.
Banks reported, on balance, a considerable increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Chart 2), driven by a stronger positive contribution of firms’
financing needs for both working capital and fixed investment compared with the previous quarter. In addition, banks continued to report a positive impact on loan demand from other financing needs, which include M&A activity and debt refinancing and restructuring. Demand for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households increased in net terms in the fourth quarter of 2021. Consumer confidence and the low general level of interest rates continued to support the demand for loans to households across loan categories. In addition, housing market prospects had a positive impact on the demand for housing loans, whereas spending on durables had a small negative impact on consumer credit. In the first quarter of 2022, banks expect net demand to continue to increase for loans to firms and households.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail funding continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, banks reported that supervisory and regulatory actions had a positive effect on their capital position in 2021. At the same time, euro area banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises and for consumer credit, whereas the impact continued to be neutral on credit standards for loans to households for house purchase in the second half of 2021. Across the main economic sectors, euro area banks indicated moderately tightened or broadly unchanged credit standards for new loans to enterprises. Finally, euro area banks reported that COVID-19 related government guarantees continued to support banks’ credit standards for loans to firms in the second half of 2021. Demand for loans with COVID-19 related government guarantees declined on balance, while it increased for loans without such guarantees.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the January 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expected changes in the first quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The January 2022 survey round was conducted between 13 December 2021 and 11 January 2022. A total of 152 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

347,000 counterfeit euro banknotes withdrawn from circulation in 2021, a historically low level in proportion to banknotes in circulation
About two-thirds of total withdrawn counterfeits were €20 and €50 banknotes
Euro banknotes remain a trusted and safe means of payment
Authenticity of euro banknotes can be verified using “feel, look and tilt” method
Some 347,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2021 (180,000 in the second half of the year), a decrease of 24.6% when compared with 2020. €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, jointly accounting for about two-thirds of the total. 95.4% of counterfeits were found in euro area countries, while 4.2% were found in non-euro area EU Member States and 0.4% in other parts of the world.
There is little likelihood of receiving a counterfeit, as the number of counterfeits remains very low in proportion to the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation. In 2021, 12 counterfeits were detected per 1 million genuine banknotes in circulation, which is a historically low level (see the chart below).
Low-quality reproductions are continuously withdrawn from circulation. Counterfeits are easy to detect as they have no security features, or only very poor imitations of them. The public does not need to be concerned about counterfeiting, but should nevertheless remain vigilant. You can check your notes by using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described in the dedicated section of the ECB’s website and on the websites of the national central banks of the euro area. The Eurosystem also helps professional cash handlers by ensuring that banknote-handling and processing machines can reliably identify counterfeits and withdraw them from circulation.
Using counterfeits for payments is a criminal offence that may lead to prosecution. If you receive a suspect banknote, compare it directly with one you know to be genuine. If your suspicions are confirmed please contact the police or – depending on national practice – your national central bank or your own retail or commercial bank. The Eurosystem supports law enforcement agencies in their fight against currency counterfeiting.
The Eurosystem has a duty to safeguard the integrity of euro banknotes and to continue improving banknote technology. The second series of banknotes – the Europa series – is even more secure and is helping to maintain public trust in the currency.

The Governing Council, the General Council, the Executive Board and the staff of the European Central Bank are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament.
Mr Sassoli was a dedicated European, a passionate President of the European Parliament since 2019, and a fighter for European democracy and human rights. As an MEP since 2009, he worked tirelessly for a more united and socially conscious Europe with citizens at its centre. His kindness and humility will be sorely missed.
“I am grieving President Sassoli’s passing. Europe has lost a leader and a tireless defender of European values,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The ECB wishes to send its heartfelt condolences to Mr Sassoli’s family and to his friends and colleagues, and is flying its flags at half-mast in his honour.
